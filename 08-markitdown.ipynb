make\\n\\nThe make utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be\\nrecompiled, and issues commands to recompile them. This manual describes GNU make,\\nwhich was implemented by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. Development since\\nVersion 3.76 has been handled by Paul D. Smith.\\n\\nGNU make conforms to section 6.2 of IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992 (POSIX.2).\\nOur examples show C programs, since they are most common, but you can use make\\nwith any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command. Indeed,\\nmake is not limited to programs. You can use it to describe any task where some files must\\nbe updated automatically from others whenever the others change.\\n\\nTo prepare to use make, you must write a file called the makefile that describes the\\nrelationships among files in your program and provides commands for updating each file.\\nIn a program, typically, the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn\\nmade by compiling source files.\\n\\nOnce a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell\\n\\ncommand:\\nmake\\n\\nsuffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The make program uses the makefile data\\nbase and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be\\nupdated. For each of those files, it issues the recipes recorded in the data base.\\n\\nYou can provide command line arguments to make to control which files should be\\n\\nrecompiled, or how. See Chapter 9 [How to Run make], page 109.\\n\\n1.1 How to Read This Manual\\n\\nIf you are new to make, or are looking for a general introduction, read the first few sections\\nof each chapter, skipping the later sections. In each chapter, the first few sections contain\\nintroductory or general information and the later sections contain specialized or technical\\ninformation. The exception is Chapter 2 [An Introduction to Makefiles], page 3, all of which\\nis introductory.\\n\\nIf you are familiar with other make programs, see Chapter 14 [Features of GNU make],\\npage 157, which lists the enhancements GNU make has, and Chapter 15 [Incompatibilities\\nand Missing Features], page 161, which explains the few things GNU make lacks that others\\nhave.\\n\\nFor a quick summary, see Section 9.8 [Options Summary], page 114, Appendix A [Quick\\n\\nReference], page 179, and Section 4.8 [Special Targets], page 34.\\n\\n1.2 Problems and Bugs\\n\\nIf you have problems with GNU make or think you’ve found a bug, please report it to the\\ndevelopers; we cannot promise to do anything but we might well want to fix it.\\n\\nBefore reporting a bug, make sure you’ve actually found a real bug. Carefully reread\\nthe documentation and see if it really says you can do what you’re trying to do. If it’s not\\nclear whether you should be able to do something or not, report that too; it’s a bug in the\\ndocumentation!\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nBefore reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it to the smallest possible\\nmakefile that reproduces the problem. Then send us the makefile and the exact results make\\ngave you, including any error or warning messages. Please don’t paraphrase these messages:\\nit’s best to cut and paste them into your report. When generating this small makefile, be\\nsure to not use any non-free or unusual tools in your recipes: you can almost always emulate\\nwhat such a tool would do with simple shell commands. Finally, be sure to explain what\\nyou expected to occur; this will help us decide whether the problem was really in the\\ndocumentation.\\n\\nOnce you have a precise problem you can report it in one of two ways. Either send\\n\\nelectronic mail to:\\n\\nbug-make@gnu.org\\n\\nor use our Web-based project management tool, at:\\n\\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/projects/make/\\n\\nIn addition to the information above, please be careful to include the version number of\\nmake you are using. You can get this information with the command ‘make --version’. Be\\nsure also to include the type of machine and operating system you are using. One way to\\nobtain this information is by looking at the final lines of output from the command ‘make\\n--help’.\\n\\nIf you have a code change you’d like to submit, see the README file section “Submitting\\n\\nPatches” for information.\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\n2 An Introduction to Makefiles\\n\\nYou need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make\\nhow to compile and link a program.\\n\\nIn this chapter, we will discuss a simple makefile that describes how to compile and link\\na text editor which consists of eight C source files and three header files. The makefile can\\nalso tell make how to run miscellaneous commands when explicitly asked (for example, to\\nremove certain files as a clean-up operation). To see a more complex example of a makefile,\\nsee Appendix C [Complex Makefile], page 191.\\n\\nWhen make recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must be recompiled. If a\\nheader file has changed, each C source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to\\nbe safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. Finally,\\nif any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved\\nfrom previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable editor.\\n\\n2.1 What a Rule Looks Like\\n\\nA simple makefile consists of “rules” with the following shape:\\n\\ntarget ... : prerequisites ...\\n\\nrecipe\\n...\\n...\\n\\nA target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets\\nare executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such\\nas ‘clean’ (see Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31).\\n\\nA prerequisite is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends\\n\\non several files.\\n\\nA recipe is an action that make carries out. A recipe may have more than one command,\\neither on the same line or each on its own line. Please note: you need to put a tab character\\nat the beginning of every recipe line! This is an obscurity that catches the unwary. If you\\nprefer to prefix your recipes with a character other than tab, you can set the .RECIPEPREFIX\\nvariable to an alternate character (see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80).\\n\\nUsually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a target file if any of\\nthe prerequisites change. However, the rule that specifies a recipe for the target need not\\nhave prerequisites. For example, the rule containing the delete command associated with\\nthe target ‘clean’ does not have prerequisites.\\n\\nA rule, then, explains how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of\\nthe particular rule. make carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update\\nthe target. A rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action. See Chapter 4\\n[Writing Rules], page 23.\\n\\nA makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile need only contain\\nrules. Rules may look somewhat more complicated than shown in this template, but all fit\\nthe pattern more or less.\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n2.2 A Simple Makefile\\n\\nHere is a straightforward makefile that describes the way an executable file called edit\\ndepends on eight object files which, in turn, depend on eight C source and three header\\nfiles.\\n\\nIn this example, all the C files include defs.h, but only those defining editing commands\\ninclude command.h, and only low level files that change the editor buffer include buffer.h.\\n\\nedit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\ncc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nmain.o : main.c defs.h\\n\\ncc -c main.c\\n\\nkbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h\\n\\ncc -c kbd.c\\n\\ncommand.o : command.c defs.h command.h\\n\\ncc -c command.c\\n\\ndisplay.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h\\n\\ncc -c display.c\\n\\ninsert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h\\n\\ncc -c insert.c\\n\\nsearch.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h\\n\\ncc -c search.c\\n\\nfiles.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h\\n\\ncc -c files.c\\n\\nutils.o : utils.c defs.h\\n\\ncc -c utils.c\\n\\nclean :\\n\\nrm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nWe split each long line into two lines using backslash/newline; this is like using one long\\nline, but is easier to read. See Section 3.1.1 [Splitting Long Lines], page 12.\\n\\nTo use this makefile to create the executable file called edit, type:\\n\\nmake\\n\\nTo use this makefile to delete the executable file and all the object files from the directory,\\n\\ntype:\\n\\nmake clean\\n\\nIn the example makefile, the targets include the executable file ‘edit’, and the object\\nfiles ‘main.o’ and ‘kbd.o’. The prerequisites are files such as ‘main.c’ and ‘defs.h’. In\\nfact, each ‘.o’ file is both a target and a prerequisite. Recipes include ‘cc -c main.c’ and\\n‘cc -c kbd.c’.\\n\\nWhen a target is a file, it needs to be recompiled or relinked if any of its prerequisites\\nchange. In addition, any prerequisites that are themselves automatically generated should\\nbe updated first. In this example, edit depends on each of the eight object files; the object\\nfile main.o depends on the source file main.c and on the header file defs.h.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 2: An Introduction to Makefiles\\n\\n5\\n\\nA recipe may follow each line that contains a target and prerequisites. These recipes say\\nhow to update the target file. A tab character (or whatever character is specified by the\\n.RECIPEPREFIX variable; see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80) must come at the\\nbeginning of every line in the recipe to distinguish recipes from other lines in the makefile.\\n(Bear in mind that make does not know anything about how the recipes work. It is up to\\nyou to supply recipes that will update the target file properly. All make does is execute the\\nrecipe you have specified when the target file needs to be updated.)\\n\\nThe target ‘clean’ is not a file, but merely the name of an action. Since you normally\\ndo not want to carry out the actions in this rule, ‘clean’ is not a prerequisite of any other\\nrule. Consequently, make never does anything with it unless you tell it specifically. Note\\nthat this rule not only is not a prerequisite, it also does not have any prerequisites, so the\\nonly purpose of the rule is to run the specified recipe. Targets that do not refer to files\\nbut are just actions are called phony targets. See Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31, for\\ninformation about this kind of target. See Section 5.5 [Errors in Recipes], page 54, to see\\nhow to cause make to ignore errors from rm or any other command.\\n\\n2.3 How make Processes a Makefile\\nBy default, make starts with the first target (not targets whose names start with ‘.’ unless\\nthey also contain one or more ‘/’). This is called the default goal. (Goals are the targets\\nthat make strives ultimately to update. You can override this behavior using the command\\nline (see Section 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals], page 109) or with the .DEFAULT_GOAL\\nspecial variable (see Section 6.14 [Other Special Variables], page 80).\\n\\nIn the simple example of the previous section, the default goal is to update the executable\\n\\nprogram edit; therefore, we put that rule first.\\n\\nThus, when you give the command:\\n\\nmake\\n\\nmake reads the makefile in the current directory and begins by processing the first rule. In\\nthe example, this rule is for relinking edit; but before make can fully process this rule, it\\nmust process the rules for the files that edit depends on, which in this case are the object\\nfiles. Each of these files is processed according to its own rule. These rules say to update\\neach ‘.o’ file by compiling its source file. The recompilation must be done if the source file,\\nor any of the header files named as prerequisites, is more recent than the object file, or if\\nthe object file does not exist.\\n\\nThe other rules are processed because their targets appear as prerequisites of the goal.\\nIf some other rule is not depended on by the goal (or anything it depends on, etc.), that\\nrule is not processed, unless you tell make to do so (with a command such as make clean).\\n\\nBefore recompiling an object file, make considers updating its prerequisites, the source\\nfile and header files. This makefile does not specify anything to be done for them—the ‘.c’\\nand ‘.h’ files are not the targets of any rules—so make does nothing for these files. But\\nmake would update automatically generated C programs, such as those made by Bison or\\nYacc, by their own rules at this time.\\n\\nAfter recompiling whichever object files need it, make decides whether to relink edit.\\nThis must be done if the file edit does not exist, or if any of the object files are newer than\\nit. If an object file was just recompiled, it is now newer than edit, so edit is relinked.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThus, if we change the file insert.c and run make, make will compile that file to update\\ninsert.o, and then link edit. If we change the file command.h and run make, make will\\nrecompile the object files kbd.o, command.o and files.o and then link the file edit.\\n\\n2.4 Variables Make Makefiles Simpler\\n\\nIn our example, we had to list all the object files twice in the rule for edit (repeated here):\\n\\nedit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\ncc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nSuch duplication is error-prone; if a new object file is added to the system, we might\\nadd it to one list and forget the other. We can eliminate the risk and simplify the makefile\\nby using a variable. Variables allow a text string to be defined once and substituted in\\nmultiple places later (see Chapter 6 [How to Use Variables], page 65).\\n\\nIt is standard practice for every makefile to have a variable named objects, OBJECTS,\\nobjs, OBJS, obj, or OBJ which is a list of all object file names. We would define such a\\nvariable objects with a line like this in the makefile:\\n\\nobjects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nThen, each place we want to put a list of the object file names, we can substitute the\\nvariable’s value by writing ‘$(objects)’ (see Chapter 6 [How to Use Variables], page 65).\\nHere is how the complete simple makefile looks when you use a variable for the object\\n\\nfiles:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 2: An Introduction to Makefiles\\n\\n7\\n\\nobjects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nedit : $(objects)\\n\\ncc -o edit $(objects)\\n\\nmain.o : main.c defs.h\\n\\ncc -c main.c\\n\\nkbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h\\n\\ncc -c kbd.c\\n\\ncommand.o : command.c defs.h command.h\\n\\ncc -c command.c\\n\\ndisplay.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h\\n\\ncc -c display.c\\n\\ninsert.o : insert.c defs.h buffer.h\\n\\ncc -c insert.c\\n\\nsearch.o : search.c defs.h buffer.h\\n\\ncc -c search.c\\n\\nfiles.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h\\n\\ncc -c files.c\\n\\nutils.o : utils.c defs.h\\n\\ncc -c utils.c\\n\\nclean :\\n\\nrm edit $(objects)\\n\\n2.5 Letting make Deduce the Recipes\\nIt is not necessary to spell out the recipes for compiling the individual C source files,\\nbecause make can figure them out:\\nit has an implicit rule for updating a ‘.o’ file from\\na correspondingly named ‘.c’ file using a ‘cc -c’ command. For example, it will use the\\nrecipe ‘cc -c main.c -o main.o’ to compile main.c into main.o. We can therefore omit the\\nrecipes from the rules for the object files. See Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules], page 121.\\n\\nWhen a ‘.c’ file is used automatically in this way, it is also automatically added to the\\nlist of prerequisites. We can therefore omit the ‘.c’ files from the prerequisites, provided\\nwe omit the recipe.\\n\\nHere is the entire example, with both of these changes, and a variable objects as\\n\\nsuggested above:\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nobjects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nedit : $(objects)\\n\\ncc -o edit $(objects)\\n\\nmain.o : defs.h\\nkbd.o : defs.h command.h\\ncommand.o : defs.h command.h\\ndisplay.o : defs.h buffer.h\\ninsert.o : defs.h buffer.h\\nsearch.o : defs.h buffer.h\\nfiles.o : defs.h buffer.h command.h\\nutils.o : defs.h\\n\\n.PHONY : clean\\nclean :\\n\\nrm edit $(objects)\\n\\nThis is how we would write the makefile in actual practice.\\n(The complications associ-\\nated with ‘clean’ are described elsewhere. See Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31, and\\nSection 5.5 [Errors in Recipes], page 54.)\\n\\nBecause implicit rules are so convenient, they are important. You will see them used\\n\\nfrequently.\\n\\n2.6 Another Style of Makefile\\n\\nWhen the objects of a makefile are created only by implicit rules, an alternative style of\\nmakefile is possible. In this style of makefile, you group entries by their prerequisites instead\\nof by their targets. Here is what one looks like:\\n\\nobjects = main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \\\\\\n\\ninsert.o search.o files.o utils.o\\n\\nedit : $(objects)\\n\\ncc -o edit $(objects)\\n\\n$(objects) : defs.h\\nkbd.o command.o files.o : command.h\\ndisplay.o insert.o search.o files.o : buffer.h\\n\\nHere defs.h is given as a prerequisite of all the object files; command.h and buffer.h are\\nprerequisites of the specific object files listed for them.\\n\\nWhether this is better is a matter of taste: it is more compact, but some people dislike\\n\\nit because they find it clearer to put all the information about each target in one place.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 2: An Introduction to Makefiles\\n\\n9\\n\\n2.7 Rules for Cleaning the Directory\\n\\nCompiling a program is not the only thing you might want to write rules for. Makefiles\\ncommonly tell how to do a few other things besides compiling a program: for example, how\\nto delete all the object files and executables so that the directory is ‘clean’.\\nHere is how we could write a make rule for cleaning our example editor:\\n\\nclean:\\n\\nrm edit $(objects)\\n\\nIn practice, we might want to write the rule in a somewhat more complicated manner\\n\\nto handle unanticipated situations. We would do this:\\n\\n.PHONY : clean\\nclean :\\n\\n-rm edit $(objects)\\n\\nThis prevents make from getting confused by an actual file called clean and causes it to\\ncontinue in spite of errors from rm. (See Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31, and Section 5.5\\n[Errors in Recipes], page 54.)\\nA rule such as this should not be placed at the beginning of the makefile, because we do\\nnot want it to run by default! Thus, in the example makefile, we want the rule for edit,\\nwhich recompiles the editor, to remain the default goal.\\n\\nSince clean is not a prerequisite of edit, this rule will not run at all if we give the\\ncommand ‘make’ with no arguments. In order to make the rule run, we have to type ‘make\\nclean’. See Chapter 9 [How to Run make], page 109.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c11\\n\\n3 Writing Makefiles\\n\\nThe information that tells make how to recompile a system comes from reading a data base\\ncalled the makefile.\\n\\n3.1 What Makefiles Contain\\n\\nMakefiles contain five kinds of things: explicit rules, implicit rules, variable definitions,\\ndirectives, and comments. Rules, variables, and directives are described at length in later\\nchapters.\\n\\n• An explicit rule says when and how to remake one or more files, called the rule’s targets.\\nIt lists the other files that the targets depend on, called the prerequisites of the target,\\nand may also give a recipe to use to create or update the targets. See Chapter 4\\n[Writing Rules], page 23.\\n\\n• An implicit rule says when and how to remake a class of files based on their names.\\nIt describes how a target may depend on a file with a name similar to the target and\\ngives a recipe to create or update such a target. See Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules],\\npage 121.\\n\\n• A variable definition is a line that specifies a text string value for a variable that\\ncan be substituted into the text later. The simple makefile example shows a variable\\ndefinition for objects as a list of all object files (see Section 2.4 [Variables Make\\nMakefiles Simpler], page 6).\\n\\n• A directive is an instruction for make to do something special while reading the makefile.\\n\\nThese include:\\n\\n• Reading another makefile (see Section 3.3 [Including Other Makefiles], page 13).\\n• Deciding (based on the values of variables) whether to use or ignore a part of the\\n\\nmakefile (see Chapter 7 [Conditional Parts of Makefiles], page 85).\\n\\n• Defining a variable from a verbatim string containing multiple lines (see Section 6.8\\n\\n[Defining Multi-Line Variables], page 76).\\n\\n• ‘#’ in a line of a makefile starts a comment. It and the rest of the line are ignored,\\nexcept that a trailing backslash not escaped by another backslash will continue the\\ncomment across multiple lines. A line containing just a comment (with perhaps spaces\\nbefore it) is effectively blank, and is ignored. If you want a literal #, escape it with a\\nbackslash (e.g., \\\\#). Comments may appear on any line in the makefile, although they\\nare treated specially in certain situations.\\nYou cannot use comments within variable references or function calls: any instance\\nof # will be treated literally (rather than as the start of a comment) inside a variable\\nreference or function call.\\nComments within a recipe are passed to the shell, just as with any other recipe text.\\nThe shell decides how to interpret it: whether or not this is a comment is up to the\\nshell.\\nWithin a define directive, comments are not ignored during the definition of the\\nvariable, but rather kept intact in the value of the variable. When the variable is\\nexpanded they will either be treated as make comments or as recipe text, depending\\non the context in which the variable is evaluated.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n3.1.1 Splitting Long Lines\\nMakefiles use a “line-based” syntax in which the newline character is special and marks the\\nend of a statement. GNU make has no limit on the length of a statement line, up to the\\namount of memory in your computer.\\n\\nHowever, it is difficult to read lines which are too long to display without wrapping or\\nscrolling. So, you can format your makefiles for readability by adding newlines into the\\nmiddle of a statement: you do this by escaping the internal newlines with a backslash (\\\\)\\ncharacter. Where we need to make a distinction we will refer to “physical lines” as a single\\nline ending with a newline (regardless of whether it is escaped) and a “logical line” being a\\ncomplete statement including all escaped newlines up to the first non-escaped newline.\\n\\nThe way in which backslash/newline combinations are handled depends on whether the\\nstatement is a recipe line or a non-recipe line. Handling of backslash/newline in a recipe\\nline is discussed later (see Section 5.1.1 [Splitting Recipe Lines], page 45).\\n\\nOutside of recipe lines, backslash/newlines are converted into a single space character.\\nOnce that is done, all whitespace around the backslash/newline is condensed into a single\\nspace: this includes all whitespace preceding the backslash, all whitespace at the beginning\\nof the line after the backslash/newline, and any consecutive backslash/newline combina-\\ntions.\\n\\nIf the .POSIX special target is defined then backslash/newline handling is modified\\nslightly to conform to POSIX.2: first, whitespace preceding a backslash is not removed\\nand second, consecutive backslash/newlines are not condensed.\\n\\nSplitting Without Adding Whitespace\\nIf you need to split a line but do not want any whitespace added, you can utilize a subtle\\ntrick: replace your backslash/newline pairs with the three characters dollar sign, backslash,\\nand newline:\\n\\nvar := one$\\\\\\n\\nword\\n\\nAfter make removes the backslash/newline and condenses the following line into a single\\n\\nspace, this is equivalent to:\\n\\nvar := one$ word\\n\\nThen make will perform variable expansion. The variable reference ‘$ ’ refers to a variable\\nwith the one-character name “ ” (space) which does not exist, and so expands to the empty\\nstring, giving a final assignment which is the equivalent of:\\n\\nvar := oneword\\n\\n3.2 What Name to Give Your Makefile\\n\\nBy default, when make looks for the makefile,\\nGNUmakefile, makefile and Makefile.\\n\\nit tries the following names,\\n\\nin order:\\n\\nNormally you should call your makefile either makefile or Makefile. (We recommend\\nMakefile because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right\\nnear other important files such as README.) The first name checked, GNUmakefile, is not\\nrecommended for most makefiles. You should use this name if you have a makefile that is\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3: Writing Makefiles\\n\\n13\\n\\nspecific to GNU make, and will not be understood by other versions of make. Other make\\nprograms look for makefile and Makefile, but not GNUmakefile.\\n\\nIf make finds none of these names, it does not use any makefile. Then you must specify\\na goal with a command argument, and make will attempt to figure out how to remake it\\nusing only its built-in implicit rules. See Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules], page 121.\\n\\nIf you want to use a nonstandard name for your makefile, you can specify the makefile\\nname with the ‘-f’ or ‘--file’ option. The arguments ‘-f name’ or ‘--file=name’ tell\\nmake to read the file name as the makefile.\\nIf you use more than one ‘-f’ or ‘--file’\\noption, you can specify several makefiles. All the makefiles are effectively concatenated in\\nthe order specified. The default makefile names GNUmakefile, makefile and Makefile are\\nnot checked automatically if you specify ‘-f’ or ‘--file’.\\n\\n3.3 Including Other Makefiles\\n\\nThe include directive tells make to suspend reading the current makefile and read one or\\nmore other makefiles before continuing. The directive is a line in the makefile that looks\\nlike this:\\n\\ninclude filenames...\\n\\nfilenames can contain shell file name patterns. If filenames is empty, nothing is included\\nand no error is printed.\\n\\nExtra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the line, but the first character\\nmust not be a tab (or the value of .RECIPEPREFIX)—if the line begins with a tab, it will\\nbe considered a recipe line. Whitespace is required between include and the file names,\\nand between file names; extra whitespace is ignored there and at the end of the directive.\\nA comment starting with ‘#’ is allowed at the end of the line. If the file names contain any\\nvariable or function references, they are expanded. See Chapter 6 [How to Use Variables],\\npage 65.\\n\\nFor example, if you have three .mk files, a.mk, b.mk, and c.mk, and $(bar) expands to\\n\\nbish bash, then the following expression\\n\\ninclude foo *.mk $(bar)\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\ninclude foo a.mk b.mk c.mk bish bash\\n\\nWhen make processes an include directive, it suspends reading of the containing makefile\\nand reads from each listed file in turn. When that is finished, make resumes reading the\\nmakefile in which the directive appears.\\n\\nOne occasion for using include directives is when several programs, handled by indi-\\nvidual makefiles in various directories, need to use a common set of variable definitions (see\\nSection 6.5 [Setting Variables], page 72) or pattern rules (see Section 10.5 [Defining and\\nRedefining Pattern Rules], page 129).\\n\\nAnother such occasion is when you want to generate prerequisites from source files\\nautomatically; the prerequisites can be put in a file that is included by the main makefile.\\nThis practice is generally cleaner than that of somehow appending the prerequisites to the\\nend of the main makefile as has been traditionally done with other versions of make. See\\nSection 4.13 [Automatic Prerequisites], page 42.\\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nIf the specified name does not start with a slash (or a drive letter and colon when GNU\\nMake is compiled with MS-DOS / MS-Windows path support), and the file is not found in\\nthe current directory, several other directories are searched. First, any directories you have\\nspecified with the ‘-I’ or ‘--include-dir’ options are searched (see Section 9.8 [Summary\\nof Options], page 114). Then the following directories (if they exist) are searched, in\\nprefix/include (normally /usr/local/include1) /usr/gnu/include,\\nthis order:\\n/usr/local/include, /usr/include.\\n\\nThe .INCLUDE_DIRS variable will contain the current list of directories that make will\\n\\nsearch for included files. See Section 6.14 [Other Special Variables], page 80.\\n\\nYou can avoid searching in these default directories by adding the command line option\\n-I with the special value - (e.g., -I-) to the command line. This will cause make to forget\\nany already-set include directories, including the default directories.\\n\\nIf an included makefile cannot be found in any of these directories it is not an immediately\\nfatal error; processing of the makefile containing the include continues. Once it has finished\\nreading makefiles, make will try to remake any that are out of date or don’t exist. See\\nSection 3.5 [How Makefiles Are Remade], page 15. Only after it has failed to find a rule to\\nremake the makefile, or it found a rule but the recipe failed, will make diagnose the missing\\nmakefile as a fatal error.\\n\\nIf you want make to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist or cannot be remade,\\n\\nwith no error message, use the -include directive instead of include, like this:\\n\\n-include filenames...\\n\\nThis acts like include in every way except that there is no error (not even a warning)\\nif any of the filenames (or any prerequisites of any of the filenames) do not exist or cannot\\nbe remade.\\n\\nFor compatibility with some other make implementations, sinclude is another name for\\n\\n-include.\\n\\n3.4 The Variable MAKEFILES\\nIf the environment variable MAKEFILES is defined, make considers its value as a list of\\nnames (separated by whitespace) of additional makefiles to be read before the others. This\\nworks much like the include directive: various directories are searched for those files (see\\nSection 3.3 [Including Other Makefiles], page 13).\\nIn addition, the default goal is never\\ntaken from one of these makefiles (or any makefile included by them) and it is not an error\\nif the files listed in MAKEFILES are not found.\\n\\nThe main use of MAKEFILES is in communication between recursive invocations of make\\n(see Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56). It usually is not desirable to set the\\nenvironment variable before a top-level invocation of make, because it is usually better not\\nto mess with a makefile from outside. However, if you are running make without a specific\\nmakefile, a makefile in MAKEFILES can do useful things to help the built-in implicit rules\\nwork better, such as defining search paths (see Section 4.4 [Directory Search], page 27).\\n\\nSome users are tempted to set MAKEFILES in the environment automatically on login,\\nand program makefiles to expect this to be done. This is a very bad idea, because such\\n\\n1 GNU Make compiled for MS-DOS and MS-Windows behaves as if prefix has been defined to be the root\\n\\nof the DJGPP tree hierarchy.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3: Writing Makefiles\\n\\n15\\n\\nmakefiles will fail to work if run by anyone else. It is much better to write explicit include\\ndirectives in the makefiles. See Section 3.3 [Including Other Makefiles], page 13.\\n\\n3.5 How Makefiles Are Remade\\n\\nSometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS files. If a makefile\\ncan be remade from other files, you probably want make to get an up-to-date version of the\\nmakefile to read in.\\n\\nTo this end, after reading in all makefiles make will consider each as a goal target, in\\nthe order in which they were processed, and attempt to update it. If parallel builds (see\\nSection 5.4 [Parallel Execution], page 51) are enabled then makefiles will be rebuilt in\\nparallel as well.\\n\\nIf a makefile has a rule which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile\\nor in another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (see Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules],\\npage 121), it will be updated if necessary. After all makefiles have been checked, if any have\\nactually been changed, make starts with a clean slate and reads all the makefiles over again.\\n(It will also attempt to update each of them over again, but normally this will not change\\nthem again, since they are already up to date.) Each restart will cause the special variable\\nMAKE_RESTARTS to be updated (see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80).\\n\\nIf you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and you want to keep\\nmake from performing an implicit rule search on them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you\\ncan use any normal method of preventing implicit rule look-up to do so. For example,\\nyou can write an explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty recipe (see\\nSection 5.9 [Using Empty Recipes], page 62).\\n\\nIf the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with a recipe but no prereq-\\nuisites, that file will always be remade (see Section 4.12 [Double-Colon], page 42). In the\\ncase of makefiles, a makefile that has a double-colon rule with a recipe but no prerequisites\\nwill be remade every time make is run, and then again after make starts over and reads the\\nmakefiles in again. This would cause an infinite loop: make would constantly remake the\\nmakefile and restart, and never do anything else. So, to avoid this, make will not attempt\\nto remake makefiles which are specified as targets of a double-colon rule with a recipe but\\nno prerequisites.\\n\\nPhony targets (see Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31) have the same effect: they are\\nnever considered up-to-date and so an included file marked as phony would cause make to\\nrestart continuously. To avoid this make will not attempt to remake makefiles which are\\nmarked phony.\\n\\nYou can take advantage of this to optimize startup time:\\n\\nif you know you don’t need\\nyour Makefile to be remade you can prevent make from trying to remake it by adding\\neither:\\n\\n.PHONY: Makefile\\n\\nor:\\n\\nMakefile:: ;\\n\\nIf you do not specify any makefiles to be read with ‘-f’ or ‘--file’ options, make will try\\nthe default makefile names; see Section 3.2 [What Name to Give Your Makefile], page 12.\\nUnlike makefiles explicitly requested with ‘-f’ or ‘--file’ options, make is not certain that\\n\\n\\x0c16\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nthese makefiles should exist. However, if a default makefile does not exist but can be created\\nby running make rules, you probably want the rules to be run so that the makefile can be\\nused.\\n\\nTherefore, if none of the default makefiles exists, make will try to make each of them\\nuntil it succeeds in making one, or it runs out of names to try. Note that it is not an error\\nif make cannot find or make any makefile; a makefile is not always necessary.\\n\\nWhen you use the ‘-t’ or ‘--touch’ option (see Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes],\\npage 111), you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which targets to\\ntouch. So the ‘-t’ option has no effect on updating makefiles; they are really updated even\\nif ‘-t’ is specified. Likewise, ‘-q’ (or ‘--question’) and ‘-n’ (or ‘--just-print’) do not\\nprevent updating of makefiles, because an out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong\\noutput for other targets. Thus, ‘make -f mfile -n foo’ will update mfile, read it in, and\\nthen print the recipe to update foo and its prerequisites without running it. The recipe\\nprinted for foo will be the one specified in the updated contents of mfile.\\n\\nHowever, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even the makefiles.\\nYou can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in the command line as well as specifying\\nthem as makefiles. When the makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options ‘-t’\\nand so on do apply to them.\\n\\nThus, ‘make -f mfile -n mfile foo’ would read the makefile mfile, print the recipe\\nneeded to update it without actually running it, and then print the recipe needed to update\\nfoo without running that. The recipe for foo will be the one specified by the existing\\ncontents of mfile.\\n\\n3.6 Overriding Part of Another Makefile\\n\\nSometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like another makefile. You\\ncan often use the ‘include’ directive to include one in the other, and add more targets or\\nvariable definitions. However, it is invalid for two makefiles to give different recipes for the\\nsame target. But there is another way.\\n\\nIn the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other), you can use a\\nmatch-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any target that cannot be made from\\nthe information in the containing makefile, make should look in another makefile. See\\nSection 10.5 [Pattern Rules], page 129, for more information on pattern rules.\\n\\nFor example, if you have a makefile called Makefile that says how to make the target\\n\\n‘foo’ (and other targets), you can write a makefile called GNUmakefile that contains:\\n\\nfoo:\\n\\nfrobnicate > foo\\n\\n%: force\\n\\n@$(MAKE) -f Makefile $@\\n\\nforce: ;\\n\\nIf you say ‘make foo’, make will find GNUmakefile, read it, and see that to make foo,\\nit needs to run the recipe ‘frobnicate > foo’.\\nIf you say ‘make bar’, make will find no\\n‘make\\nway to make bar in GNUmakefile, so it will use the recipe from the pattern rule:\\n-f Makefile bar’. If Makefile provides a rule for updating bar, make will apply the rule.\\nAnd likewise for any other target that GNUmakefile does not say how to make.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3: Writing Makefiles\\n\\n17\\n\\nThe way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just ‘%’, so it matches any\\ntarget whatever. The rule specifies a prerequisite force, to guarantee that the recipe will\\nbe run even if the target file already exists. We give the force target an empty recipe to\\nprevent make from searching for an implicit rule to build it—otherwise it would apply the\\nsame match-anything rule to force itself and create a prerequisite loop!\\n\\n3.7 How make Reads a Makefile\\nGNU make does its work in two distinct phases. During the first phase it reads all the\\nmakefiles, included makefiles, etc. and internalizes all the variables and their values and\\nimplicit and explicit rules, and builds a dependency graph of all the targets and their\\nprerequisites. During the second phase, make uses this internalized data to determine which\\ntargets need to be updated and run the recipes necessary to update them.\\n\\nIt’s important to understand this two-phase approach because it has a direct impact on\\nhow variable and function expansion happens; this is often a source of some confusion when\\nwriting makefiles. Below is a summary of the different constructs that can be found in a\\nmakefile, and the phase in which expansion happens for each part of the construct.\\n\\nWe say that expansion is immediate if it happens during the first phase: make will expand\\nthat part of the construct as the makefile is parsed. We say that expansion is deferred if it\\nis not immediate. Expansion of a deferred construct part is delayed until the expansion is\\nused: either when it is referenced in an immediate context, or when it is needed during the\\nsecond phase.\\n\\nYou may not be familiar with some of these constructs yet. You can reference this section\\n\\nas you become familiar with them, in later chapters.\\n\\nVariable Assignment\\nVariable definitions are parsed as follows:\\n\\nimmediate = deferred\\nimmediate ?= deferred\\nimmediate := immediate\\nimmediate ::= immediate\\nimmediate :::= immediate-with-escape\\nimmediate += deferred or immediate\\nimmediate != immediate\\n\\ndefine immediate\\n\\ndeferred\\n\\nendef\\n\\ndefine immediate =\\n\\ndeferred\\n\\nendef\\n\\ndefine immediate ?=\\n\\ndeferred\\n\\nendef\\n\\n\\x0c18\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ndefine immediate :=\\n\\nimmediate\\n\\nendef\\n\\ndefine immediate ::=\\n\\nimmediate\\n\\nendef\\n\\ndefine immediate :::=\\n\\nimmediate-with-escape\\n\\nendef\\n\\ndefine immediate +=\\n\\ndeferred or immediate\\n\\nendef\\n\\ndefine immediate !=\\n\\nimmediate\\n\\nendef\\n\\nFor the append operator ‘+=’, the right-hand side is considered immediate if the variable\\n\\nwas previously set as a simple variable (‘:=’ or ‘::=’), and deferred otherwise.\\n\\nFor the immediate-with-escape operator ‘:::=’, the value on the right-hand side is imme-\\ndiately expanded but then escaped (that is, all instances of $ in the result of the expansion\\nare replaced with $$).\\n\\nFor the shell assignment operator ‘!=’, the right-hand side is evaluated immediately\\nand handed to the shell. The result is stored in the variable named on the left, and that\\nvariable is considered a recursively expanded variable (and will thus be re-evaluated on each\\nreference).\\n\\nConditional Directives\\nConditional directives are parsed immediately. This means, for example, that automatic\\nvariables cannot be used in conditional directives, as automatic variables are not set until\\nthe recipe for that rule is invoked. If you need to use automatic variables in a conditional\\ndirective you must move the condition into the recipe and use shell conditional syntax\\ninstead.\\n\\nRule Definition\\nA rule is always expanded the same way, regardless of the form:\\n\\nimmediate : immediate ; deferred\\n\\ndeferred\\n\\nThat is, the target and prerequisite sections are expanded immediately, and the recipe\\nused to build the target is always deferred. This is true for explicit rules, pattern rules,\\nsuffix rules, static pattern rules, and simple prerequisite definitions.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3: Writing Makefiles\\n\\n19\\n\\n3.8 How Makefiles Are Parsed\\n\\nGNU make parses makefiles line-by-line. Parsing proceeds using the following steps:\\n\\n1. Read in a full logical line, including backslash-escaped lines (see Section 3.1.1 [Splitting\\n\\nLong Lines], page 12).\\n\\n2. Remove comments (see Section 3.1 [What Makefiles Contain], page 11).\\n3. If the line begins with the recipe prefix character and we are in a rule context, add\\nthe line to the current recipe and read the next line (see Section 5.1 [Recipe Syntax],\\npage 45).\\n\\n4. Expand elements of the line which appear in an immediate expansion context (see\\n\\nSection 3.7 [How make Reads a Makefile], page 17).\\n\\n5. Scan the line for a separator character, such as ‘:’ or ‘=’, to determine whether the line\\n\\nis a macro assignment or a rule (see Section 5.1 [Recipe Syntax], page 45).\\n\\n6. Internalize the resulting operation and read the next line.\\n\\nAn important consequence of this is that a macro can expand to an entire rule, if it is\\n\\none line long. This will work:\\n\\nmyrule = target : ; echo built\\n\\n$(myrule)\\n\\nHowever, this will not work because make does not re-split lines after it has expanded\\n\\nthem:\\n\\ndefine myrule\\ntarget:\\n\\necho built\\n\\nendef\\n\\n$(myrule)\\n\\nThe above makefile results in the definition of a target ‘target’ with prerequisites ‘echo’\\nand ‘built’, as if the makefile contained target: echo built, rather than a rule with a\\nrecipe. Newlines still present in a line after expansion is complete are ignored as normal\\nwhitespace.\\n\\nIn order to properly expand a multi-line macro you must use the eval function: this\\ncauses the make parser to be run on the results of the expanded macro (see Section 8.10\\n[Eval Function], page 103).\\n\\n3.9 Secondary Expansion\\n\\nPreviously we learned that GNU make works in two distinct phases: a read-in phase and a\\ntarget-update phase (see Section 3.7 [How make Reads a Makefile], page 17). GNU Make\\nalso has the ability to enable a second expansion of the prerequisites (only) for some or\\nall targets defined in the makefile. In order for this second expansion to occur, the special\\ntarget .SECONDEXPANSION must be defined before the first prerequisite list that makes use\\nof this feature.\\n\\nIf .SECONDEXPANSION is defined then when GNU make needs to check the prerequisites\\nIn most circumstances this\\n\\nof a target, the prerequisites are expanded a second time.\\n\\n\\x0c20\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nsecondary expansion will have no effect, since all variable and function references will have\\nbeen expanded during the initial parsing of the makefiles. In order to take advantage of\\nthe secondary expansion phase of the parser, then, it’s necessary to escape the variable or\\nfunction reference in the makefile. In this case the first expansion merely un-escapes the\\nreference but doesn’t expand it, and expansion is left to the secondary expansion phase.\\nFor example, consider this makefile:\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\nONEVAR = onefile\\nTWOVAR = twofile\\nmyfile: $(ONEVAR) $$(TWOVAR)\\n\\nAfter the first expansion phase the prerequisites list of the myfile target will be onefile\\nand $(TWOVAR); the first (unescaped) variable reference to ONEVAR is expanded, while\\nthe second (escaped) variable reference is simply unescaped, without being recognized as a\\nvariable reference. Now during the secondary expansion the first word is expanded again\\nbut since it contains no variable or function references it remains the value onefile, while\\nthe second word is now a normal reference to the variable TWOVAR, which is expanded\\nto the value twofile. The final result is that there are two prerequisites, onefile and\\ntwofile.\\n\\nObviously, this is not a very interesting case since the same result could more easily have\\nbeen achieved simply by having both variables appear, unescaped, in the prerequisites list.\\nOne difference becomes apparent if the variables are reset; consider this example:\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\nAVAR = top\\nonefile: $(AVAR)\\ntwofile: $$(AVAR)\\nAVAR = bottom\\n\\nHere the prerequisite of onefile will be expanded immediately, and resolve to the value\\ntop, while the prerequisite of twofile will not be full expanded until the secondary expan-\\nsion and yield a value of bottom.\\n\\nThis is marginally more exciting, but the true power of this feature only becomes ap-\\nparent when you discover that secondary expansions always take place within the scope of\\nthe automatic variables for that target. This means that you can use variables such as $@,\\n$*, etc. during the second expansion and they will have their expected values, just as in\\nthe recipe. All you have to do is defer the expansion by escaping the $. Also, secondary\\nexpansion occurs for both explicit and implicit (pattern) rules. Knowing this, the possible\\nuses for this feature increase dramatically. For example:\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\nmain_OBJS := main.o try.o test.o\\nlib_OBJS := lib.o api.o\\n\\nmain lib: $$($$@_OBJS)\\n\\nHere, after the initial expansion the prerequisites of both the main and lib targets will\\nbe $($@_OBJS). During the secondary expansion, the $@ variable is set to the name of the\\ntarget and so the expansion for the main target will yield $(main_OBJS), or main.o try.o\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 3: Writing Makefiles\\n\\n21\\n\\ntest.o, while the secondary expansion for the lib target will yield $(lib_OBJS), or lib.o\\napi.o.\\n\\nYou can also mix in functions here, as long as they are properly escaped:\\n\\nmain_SRCS := main.c try.c test.c\\nlib_SRCS := lib.c api.c\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\nmain lib: $$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$$($$@_SRCS))\\n\\nThis version allows users to specify source files rather than object files, but gives the\\n\\nsame resulting prerequisites list as the previous example.\\n\\nEvaluation of automatic variables during the secondary expansion phase, especially of\\nthe target name variable $$@, behaves similarly to evaluation within recipes. However, there\\nare some subtle differences and “corner cases” which come into play for the different types\\nof rule definitions that make understands. The subtleties of using the different automatic\\nvariables are described below.\\n\\nSecondary Expansion of Explicit Rules\\nDuring the secondary expansion of explicit rules, $$@ and $$% evaluate, respectively, to the\\nfile name of the target and, when the target is an archive member, the target member name.\\nThe $$< variable evaluates to the first prerequisite in the first rule for this target. $$^ and\\n$$+ evaluate to the list of all prerequisites of rules that have already appeared for the same\\ntarget ($$+ with repetitions and $$^ without). The following example will help illustrate\\nthese behaviors:\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\n\\nfoo: foo.1 bar.1 $$< $$^ $$+\\n\\n# line #1\\n\\nfoo: foo.2 bar.2 $$< $$^ $$+\\n\\n# line #2\\n\\nfoo: foo.3 bar.3 $$< $$^ $$+\\n\\n# line #3\\n\\nIn the first prerequisite list, all three variables ($$<, $$^, and $$+) expand to the empty\\nstring. In the second, they will have values foo.1, foo.1 bar.1, and foo.1 bar.1 respec-\\ntively.\\nIn the third they will have values foo.1, foo.1 bar.1 foo.2 bar.2, and foo.1\\nbar.1 foo.2 bar.2 foo.1 foo.1 bar.1 foo.1 bar.1 respectively.\\n\\nRules undergo secondary expansion in makefile order, except that the rule with the\\n\\nrecipe is always evaluated last.\\n\\nThe variables $$? and $$* are not available and expand to the empty string.\\n\\nSecondary Expansion of Static Pattern Rules\\nRules for secondary expansion of static pattern rules are identical to those for explicit rules,\\nabove, with one exception: for static pattern rules the $$* variable is set to the pattern\\nstem. As with explicit rules, $$? is not available and expands to the empty string.\\n\\n\\x0c22\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nSecondary Expansion of Implicit Rules\\nAs make searches for an implicit rule, it substitutes the stem and then performs secondary\\nexpansion for every rule with a matching target pattern. The value of the automatic vari-\\nables is derived in the same fashion as for static pattern rules. As an example:\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\n\\nfoo: bar\\n\\nfoo foz: fo%: bo%\\n\\n%oo: $$< $$^ $$+ $$*\\n\\nWhen the implicit rule is tried for target foo, $$< expands to bar, $$^ expands to bar\\n\\nboo, $$+ also expands to bar boo, and $$* expands to f.\\n\\nNote that the directory prefix (D), as described in Section 10.8 [Implicit Rule Search\\nAlgorithm], page 137, is appended (after expansion) to all the patterns in the prerequisites\\nlist. As an example:\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION:\\n\\n/tmp/foo.o:\\n\\n%.o: $$(addsuffix /%.c,foo bar) foo.h\\n\\n@echo $^\\n\\nThe prerequisite list printed, after the secondary expansion and directory prefix recon-\\nstruction, will be /tmp/foo/foo.c /tmp/bar/foo.c foo.h. If you are not interested in this\\nreconstruction, you can use $$* instead of % in the prerequisites list.\\n\\n\\x0c23\\n\\n4 Writing Rules\\n\\nA rule appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake certain files, called the\\nrule’s targets (most often only one per rule). It lists the other files that are the prerequisites\\nof the target, and the recipe to use to create or update the target.\\n\\nThe order of rules is not significant, except for determining the default goal: the target\\nfor make to consider, if you do not otherwise specify one. The default goal is the first target\\nof the first rule in the first makefile. There are two exceptions: a target starting with a\\nperiod is not a default unless it also contains one or more slashes, ‘/’; and, a target that\\ndefines a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal. (See Section 10.5 [Defining and\\nRedefining Pattern Rules], page 129.)\\n\\nTherefore, we usually write the makefile so that the first rule is the one for compiling\\nthe entire program or all the programs described by the makefile (often with a target called\\n‘all’). See Section 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals], page 109.\\n\\n4.1 Rule Syntax\\n\\nIn general, a rule looks like this:\\n\\ntargets : prerequisites\\nrecipe\\n...\\n\\nor like this:\\n\\ntargets : prerequisites ; recipe\\n\\nrecipe\\n...\\n\\nThe targets are file names, separated by spaces. Wildcard characters may be used (see\\nSection 4.3 [Using Wildcard Characters in File Names], page 25) and a name of the form\\na(m) represents member m in archive file a (see Section 11.1 [Archive Members as Targets],\\npage 139). Usually there is only one target per rule, but occasionally there is a reason to\\nhave more (see Section 4.9 [Multiple Targets in a Rule], page 37).\\n\\nThe recipe lines start with a tab character (or the first character in the value of the\\n.RECIPEPREFIX variable; see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80). The first recipe line\\nmay appear on the line after the prerequisites, with a tab character, or may appear on the\\nsame line, with a semicolon. Either way, the effect is the same. There are other differences\\nin the syntax of recipes. See Chapter 5 [Writing Recipes in Rules], page 45.\\n\\nBecause dollar signs are used to start make variable references, if you really want a dollar\\nsign in a target or prerequisite you must write two of them, ‘$$’ (see Chapter 6 [How to Use\\nVariables], page 65). If you have enabled secondary expansion (see Section 3.9 [Secondary\\nExpansion], page 19) and you want a literal dollar sign in the prerequisites list, you must\\nactually write four dollar signs (‘$$$$’).\\n\\nYou may split a long line by inserting a backslash followed by a newline, but this is not\\n\\nrequired, as make places no limit on the length of a line in a makefile.\\n\\nA rule tells make two things: when the targets are out of date, and how to update them\\n\\nwhen necessary.\\n\\n\\x0c24\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThe criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the prerequisites, which\\nconsist of file names separated by spaces. (Wildcards and archive members (see Chapter 11\\n[Archives], page 139) are allowed here too.) A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it\\nis older than any of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times). The idea is\\nthat the contents of the target file are computed based on information in the prerequisites,\\nso if any of the prerequisites changes, the contents of the existing target file are no longer\\nnecessarily valid.\\n\\nHow to update is specified by a recipe. This is one or more lines to be executed by\\nthe shell (normally ‘sh’), but with some extra features (see Chapter 5 [Writing Recipes in\\nRules], page 45).\\n\\n4.2 Types of Prerequisites\\n\\nThere are two different types of prerequisites understood by GNU make: normal prerequi-\\nsites, described in the previous section, and order-only prerequisites. A normal prerequisite\\nmakes two statements: first, it imposes an order in which recipes will be invoked: the recipes\\nfor all prerequisites of a target will be completed before the recipe for the target is started.\\nSecond, it imposes a dependency relationship: if any prerequisite is newer than the target,\\nthen the target is considered out-of-date and must be rebuilt.\\n\\nNormally, this is exactly what you want: if a target’s prerequisite is updated, then the\\n\\ntarget should also be updated.\\n\\nOccasionally you may want to ensure that a prerequisite is built before a target, but\\nwithout forcing the target to be updated if the prerequisite is updated. Order-only prereq-\\nuisites are used to create this type of relationship. Order-only prerequisites can be specified\\nby placing a pipe symbol (|) in the prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the\\npipe symbol are normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only:\\n\\ntargets : normal-prerequisites | order-only-prerequisites\\n\\nThe normal prerequisites section may of course be empty. Also, you may still declare\\nmultiple lines of prerequisites for the same target: they are appended appropriately (normal\\nprerequisites are appended to the list of normal prerequisites; order-only prerequisites are\\nappended to the list of order-only prerequisites). Note that if you declare the same file to\\nbe both a normal and an order-only prerequisite, the normal prerequisite takes precedence\\n(since they have a strict superset of the behavior of an order-only prerequisite).\\n\\nOrder-only prerequisites are never checked when determining if the target is out of date;\\neven order-only prerequisites marked as phony (see Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31)\\nwill not cause the target to be rebuilt.\\n\\nConsider an example where your targets are to be placed in a separate directory, and that\\ndirectory might not exist before make is run. In this situation, you want the directory to\\nbe created before any targets are placed into it but, because the timestamps on directories\\nchange whenever a file is added, removed, or renamed, we certainly don’t want to rebuild\\nall the targets whenever the directory’s timestamp changes. One way to manage this is with\\norder-only prerequisites: make the directory an order-only prerequisite on all the targets:\\n\\nOBJDIR := objdir\\nOBJS := $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/,foo.o bar.o baz.o)\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n25\\n\\n$(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c\\n\\n$(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $<\\n\\nall: $(OBJS)\\n\\n$(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)\\n\\n$(OBJDIR):\\n\\nmkdir $(OBJDIR)\\n\\nNow the rule to create the objdir directory will be run, if needed, before any ‘.o’ is\\n\\nbuilt, but no ‘.o’ will be built because the objdir directory timestamp changed.\\n\\n4.3 Using Wildcard Characters in File Names\\n\\nA single file name can specify many files using wildcard characters. The wildcard characters\\nin make are ‘*’, ‘?’ and ‘[...]’, the same as in the Bourne shell. For example, *.c specifies\\na list of all the files (in the working directory) whose names end in ‘.c’.\\n\\nIf an expression matches multiple files then the results will be sorted.1 However multiple\\nexpressions will not be globally sorted. For example, *.c *.h will list all the files whose\\nnames end in ‘.c’, sorted, followed by all the files whose names end in ‘.h’, sorted.\\n\\nThe character ‘~’ at the beginning of a file name also has special significance. If alone,\\nor followed by a slash, it represents your home directory. For example ~/bin expands to\\n/home/you/bin. If the ‘~’ is followed by a word, the string represents the home directory\\nof the user named by that word. For example ~john/bin expands to /home/john/bin. On\\nsystems which don’t have a home directory for each user (such as MS-DOS or MS-Windows),\\nthis functionality can be simulated by setting the environment variable HOME.\\n\\nWildcard expansion is performed by make automatically in targets and in prerequisites.\\nIn other contexts, wildcard\\n\\nIn recipes, the shell is responsible for wildcard expansion.\\nexpansion happens only if you request it explicitly with the wildcard function.\\n\\nThe special significance of a wildcard character can be turned off by preceding it with\\na backslash. Thus, foo\\\\*bar would refer to a specific file whose name consists of ‘foo’, an\\nasterisk, and ‘bar’.\\n\\n4.3.1 Wildcard Examples\\nWildcards can be used in the recipe of a rule, where they are expanded by the shell. For\\nexample, here is a rule to delete all the object files:\\n\\nclean:\\n\\nrm -f *.o\\n\\nWildcards are also useful in the prerequisites of a rule. With the following rule in the\\nmakefile, ‘make print’ will print all the ‘.c’ files that have changed since the last time you\\nprinted them:\\n\\nprint: *.c\\n\\nlpr -p $?\\n\\n1 Some older versions of GNU make did not sort the results of wildcard expansion.\\n\\n\\x0c26\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ntouch print\\n\\nThis rule uses print as an empty target file; see Section 4.7 [Empty Target Files to Record\\nEvents], page 34. (The automatic variable ‘$?’ is used to print only those files that have\\nchanged; see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130.)\\n\\nWildcard expansion does not happen when you define a variable. Thus, if you write this:\\n\\nobjects = *.o\\n\\nthen the value of the variable objects is the actual string ‘*.o’. However, if you use the\\nvalue of objects in a target or prerequisite, wildcard expansion will take place there. If\\nyou use the value of objects in a recipe, the shell may perform wildcard expansion when\\nthe recipe runs. To set objects to the expansion, instead use:\\n\\nobjects := $(wildcard *.o)\\n\\nSee Section 4.3.3 [Wildcard Function], page 26.\\n\\n4.3.2 Pitfalls of Using Wildcards\\nNow here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that does not do what\\nyou would intend. Suppose you would like to say that the executable file foo is made from\\nall the object files in the directory, and you write this:\\n\\nobjects = *.o\\n\\nfoo : $(objects)\\n\\ncc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)\\n\\nThe value of objects is the actual string ‘*.o’. Wildcard expansion happens in the rule\\nfor foo, so that each existing ‘.o’ file becomes a prerequisite of foo and will be recompiled\\nif necessary.\\n\\nBut what if you delete all the ‘.o’ files? When a wildcard matches no files, it is left as it\\nis, so then foo will depend on the oddly-named file *.o. Since no such file is likely to exist,\\nmake will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to make *.o. This is not what\\nyou want!\\n\\nActually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard expansion, but you need\\nmore sophisticated techniques, including the wildcard function and string substitution.\\nThese are described in the following section.\\n\\nMicrosoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes to separate\\n\\ndirectories in pathnames, like so:\\n\\nc:\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\\baz.c\\n\\nThis is equivalent to the Unix-style c:/foo/bar/baz.c (the c: part is the so-called drive\\nletter). When make runs on these systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-\\nstyle forward slashes in pathnames. However, this support does not include the wildcard\\nexpansion, where backslash is a quote character. Therefore, you must use Unix-style slashes\\nin these cases.\\n\\n4.3.3 The Function wildcard\\nWildcard expansion happens automatically in rules. But wildcard expansion does not nor-\\nmally take place when a variable is set, or inside the arguments of a function. If you want\\nto do wildcard expansion in such places, you need to use the wildcard function, like this:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n27\\n\\n$(wildcard pattern...)\\n\\nThis string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a space-separated list of names\\nof existing files that match one of the given file name patterns. If no existing file name\\nmatches a pattern, then that pattern is omitted from the output of the wildcard function.\\nNote that this is different from how unmatched wildcards behave in rules, where they are\\nused verbatim rather than ignored (see Section 4.3.2 [Wildcard Pitfall], page 26).\\n\\nAs with wildcard expansion in rules, the results of the wildcard function are sorted.\\nBut again, each individual expression is sorted separately, so ‘$(wildcard *.c *.h)’ will\\nexpand to all files matching ‘.c’, sorted, followed by all files matching ‘.h’, sorted.\\n\\nOne use of the wildcard function is to get a list of all the C source files in a directory,\\n\\nlike this:\\n\\n$(wildcard *.c)\\n\\nWe can change the list of C source files into a list of object files by replacing the ‘.c’\\n\\nsuffix with ‘.o’ in the result, like this:\\n\\n$(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))\\n\\n(Here we have used another function, patsubst. See Section 8.2 [Functions for String\\nSubstitution and Analysis], page 92.)\\n\\nThus, a makefile to compile all C source files in the directory and then link them together\\n\\ncould be written as follows:\\n\\nobjects := $(patsubst %.c,%.o,$(wildcard *.c))\\n\\nfoo : $(objects)\\n\\ncc -o foo $(objects)\\n\\n(This takes advantage of the implicit rule for compiling C programs, so there is no need to\\nwrite explicit rules for compiling the files. See Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables],\\npage 66, for an explanation of ‘:=’, which is a variant of ‘=’.)\\n\\n4.4 Searching Directories for Prerequisites\\n\\nFor large systems, it is often desirable to put sources in a separate directory from the\\nbinaries. The directory search features of make facilitate this by searching several directories\\nautomatically to find a prerequisite. When you redistribute the files among directories, you\\ndo not need to change the individual rules, just the search paths.\\n\\n4.4.1 VPATH: Search Path for All Prerequisites\\nThe value of the make variable VPATH specifies a list of directories that make should search.\\nMost often, the directories are expected to contain prerequisite files that are not in the\\ncurrent directory; however, make uses VPATH as a search list for both prerequisites and\\ntargets of rules.\\n\\nThus, if a file that is listed as a target or prerequisite does not exist in the current\\ndirectory, make searches the directories listed in VPATH for a file with that name. If a file is\\nfound in one of them, that file may become the prerequisite (see below). Rules may then\\nspecify the names of files in the prerequisite list as if they all existed in the current directory.\\nSee Section 4.4.4 [Writing Recipes with Directory Search], page 30.\\n\\n\\x0c28\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nIn the VPATH variable, directory names are separated by colons or blanks. The order in\\nwhich directories are listed is the order followed by make in its search. (On MS-DOS and\\nMS-Windows, semi-colons are used as separators of directory names in VPATH, since the\\ncolon can be used in the pathname itself, after the drive letter.)\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nVPATH = src:../headers\\n\\nspecifies a path containing two directories, src and ../headers, which make searches in\\nthat order.\\n\\nWith this value of VPATH, the following rule,\\n\\nfoo.o : foo.c\\n\\nis interpreted as if it were written like this:\\n\\nfoo.o : src/foo.c\\n\\nassuming the file foo.c does not exist in the current directory but is found in the directory\\nsrc.\\n\\n4.4.2 The vpath Directive\\nSimilar to the VPATH variable, but more selective, is the vpath directive (note lower case),\\nwhich allows you to specify a search path for a particular class of file names: those that\\nmatch a particular pattern. Thus you can supply certain search directories for one class of\\nfile names and other directories (or none) for other file names.\\n\\nThere are three forms of the vpath directive:\\n\\nvpath pattern directories\\n\\nSpecify the search path directories for file names that match pattern.\\nThe search path, directories, is a list of directories to be searched, separated\\nby colons (semi-colons on MS-DOS and MS-Windows) or blanks, just like the\\nsearch path used in the VPATH variable.\\n\\nvpath pattern\\n\\nClear out the search path associated with pattern.\\n\\nvpath\\n\\nClear all search paths previously specified with vpath directives.\\n\\nA vpath pattern is a string containing a ‘%’ character. The string must match the file\\nname of a prerequisite that is being searched for, the ‘%’ character matching any sequence\\nof zero or more characters (as in pattern rules; see Section 10.5 [Defining and Redefining\\nPattern Rules], page 129). For example, %.h matches files that end in .h. (If there is no\\n‘%’, the pattern must match the prerequisite exactly, which is not useful very often.)\\n\\n‘%’ characters in a vpath directive’s pattern can be quoted with preceding backslashes\\n(‘\\\\’). Backslashes that would otherwise quote ‘%’ characters can be quoted with more\\nbackslashes. Backslashes that quote ‘%’ characters or other backslashes are removed from\\nthe pattern before it is compared to file names. Backslashes that are not in danger of\\nquoting ‘%’ characters go unmolested.\\n\\nWhen a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the pattern in a vpath\\ndirective matches the name of the prerequisite file, then the directories in that directive are\\nsearched just like (and before) the directories in the VPATH variable.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n29\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nvpath %.h ../headers\\n\\ntells make to look for any prerequisite whose name ends in .h in the directory ../headers\\nif the file is not found in the current directory.\\n\\nIf several vpath patterns match the prerequisite file’s name, then make processes each\\nmatching vpath directive one by one, searching all the directories mentioned in each di-\\nrective. make handles multiple vpath directives in the order in which they appear in the\\nmakefile; multiple directives with the same pattern are independent of each other.\\n\\nThus,\\n\\nvpath %.c foo\\nvpath %\\nvpath %.c bar\\n\\nblish\\n\\nwill look for a file ending in ‘.c’ in foo, then blish, then bar, while\\n\\nvpath %.c foo:bar\\nvpath %\\n\\nblish\\n\\nwill look for a file ending in ‘.c’ in foo, then bar, then blish.\\n\\n4.4.3 How Directory Searches are Performed\\nWhen a prerequisite is found through directory search, regardless of type (general or se-\\nlective), the pathname located may not be the one that make actually provides you in the\\nprerequisite list. Sometimes the path discovered through directory search is thrown away.\\n\\nThe algorithm make uses to decide whether to keep or abandon a path found via directory\\n\\nsearch is as follows:\\n\\n1. If a target file does not exist at the path specified in the makefile, directory search is\\n\\nperformed.\\n\\n2. If the directory search is successful, that path is kept and this file is tentatively stored\\n\\nas the target.\\n\\n3. All prerequisites of this target are examined using this same method.\\n\\n4. After processing the prerequisites, the target may or may not need to be rebuilt:\\n\\na. If the target does not need to be rebuilt, the path to the file found during directory\\nsearch is used for any prerequisite lists which contain this target. In short, if make\\ndoesn’t need to rebuild the target then you use the path found via directory search.\\n\\nb. If the target does need to be rebuilt (is out-of-date), the pathname found during\\ndirectory search is thrown away, and the target is rebuilt using the file name\\nspecified in the makefile. In short, if make must rebuild, then the target is rebuilt\\nlocally, not in the directory found via directory search.\\n\\nThis algorithm may seem complex, but in practice it is quite often exactly what you\\n\\nwant.\\n\\nOther versions of make use a simpler algorithm: if the file does not exist, and it is found\\nvia directory search, then that pathname is always used whether or not the target needs\\nto be built. Thus, if the target is rebuilt it is created at the pathname discovered during\\ndirectory search.\\n\\n\\x0c30\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nIf, in fact, this is the behavior you want for some or all of your directories, you can use\\n\\nthe GPATH variable to indicate this to make.\\n\\nGPATH has the same syntax and format as VPATH (that is, a space- or colon-delimited list\\nof pathnames). If an out-of-date target is found by directory search in a directory that also\\nappears in GPATH, then that pathname is not thrown away. The target is rebuilt using the\\nexpanded path.\\n\\n4.4.4 Writing Recipes with Directory Search\\nWhen a prerequisite is found in another directory through directory search, this cannot\\nchange the recipe of the rule; they will execute as written. Therefore, you must write the\\nrecipe with care so that it will look for the prerequisite in the directory where make finds it.\\nThis is done with the automatic variables such as ‘$^’ (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic\\nVariables], page 130). For instance, the value of ‘$^’ is a list of all the prerequisites of the\\nrule, including the names of the directories in which they were found, and the value of ‘$@’\\nis the target. Thus:\\n\\nfoo.o : foo.c\\n\\ncc -c $(CFLAGS) $^ -o $@\\n\\n(The variable CFLAGS exists so you can specify flags for C compilation by implicit rules; we\\nuse it here for consistency so it will affect all C compilations uniformly; see Section 10.3\\n[Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125.)\\n\\nOften the prerequisites include header files as well, which you do not want to mention\\n\\nin the recipe. The automatic variable ‘$<’ is just the first prerequisite:\\n\\nVPATH = src:../headers\\nfoo.o : foo.c defs.h hack.h\\n\\ncc -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\n4.4.5 Directory Search and Implicit Rules\\nThe search through the directories specified in VPATH or with vpath also happens during\\nconsideration of implicit rules (see Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules], page 121).\\n\\nFor example, when a file foo.o has no explicit rule, make considers implicit rules, such\\nas the built-in rule to compile foo.c if that file exists. If such a file is lacking in the current\\ndirectory, the appropriate directories are searched for it. If foo.c exists (or is mentioned\\nin the makefile) in any of the directories, the implicit rule for C compilation is applied.\\n\\nThe recipes of implicit rules normally use automatic variables as a matter of necessity;\\n\\nconsequently they will use the file names found by directory search with no extra effort.\\n\\n4.4.6 Directory Search for Link Libraries\\nDirectory search applies in a special way to libraries used with the linker. This special\\nfeature comes into play when you write a prerequisite whose name is of the form ‘-lname’.\\n(You can tell something strange is going on here because the prerequisite is normally the\\nname of a file, and the file name of a library generally looks like libname.a, not like\\n‘-lname’.)\\n\\nWhen a prerequisite’s name has the form ‘-lname’, make handles it specially by searching\\nfor the file libname.so, and, if it is not found, for the file libname.a in the current directory,\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n31\\n\\nin directories specified by matching vpath search paths and the VPATH search path, and then\\nin the directories /lib, /usr/lib, and prefix/lib (normally /usr/local/lib, but MS-\\nDOS/MS-Windows versions of make behave as if prefix is defined to be the root of the\\nDJGPP installation tree).\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nif there is a /usr/lib/libcurses.a library on your system (and no\\n\\n/usr/lib/libcurses.so file), then\\nfoo : foo.c -lcurses\\n\\ncc $^ -o $@\\n\\nwould cause the command ‘cc foo.c /usr/lib/libcurses.a -o foo’ to be executed when\\nfoo is older than foo.c or than /usr/lib/libcurses.a.\\n\\nAlthough the default set of files to be searched for is libname.so and libname.a, this\\nis customizable via the .LIBPATTERNS variable. Each word in the value of this variable is\\na pattern string. When a prerequisite like ‘-lname’ is seen, make will replace the percent\\nin each pattern in the list with name and perform the above directory searches using each\\nlibrary file name.\\n\\nThe default value for .LIBPATTERNS is ‘lib%.so lib%.a’, which provides the default\\n\\nbehavior described above.\\n\\nYou can turn off link library expansion completely by setting this variable to an empty\\n\\nvalue.\\n\\n4.5 Phony Targets\\n\\nA phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is just a name for a\\nrecipe to be executed when you make an explicit request. There are two reasons to use a\\nphony target: to avoid a conflict with a file of the same name, and to improve performance.\\n\\nIf you write a rule whose recipe will not create the target file, the recipe will be executed\\n\\nevery time the target comes up for remaking. Here is an example:\\n\\nclean:\\n\\nrm *.o temp\\n\\nBecause the rm command does not create a file named clean, probably no such file will\\never exist. Therefore, the rm command will be executed every time you say ‘make clean’.\\nIn this example, the clean target will not work properly if a file named clean is ever\\ncreated in this directory. Since it has no prerequisites, clean would always be considered\\nup to date and its recipe would not be executed. To avoid this problem you can explicitly\\ndeclare the target to be phony by making it a prerequisite of the special target .PHONY (see\\nSection 4.8 [Special Built-in Target Names], page 34) as follows:\\n\\n.PHONY: clean\\nclean:\\n\\nrm *.o temp\\n\\nOnce this is done, ‘make clean’ will run the recipe regardless of whether there is a file\\nnamed clean.\\n\\nPrerequisites of .PHONY are always interpreted as literal target names, never as patterns\\n(even if they contain ‘%’ characters). To always rebuild a pattern rule consider using a\\n“force target” (see Section 4.6 [Rules without Recipes or Prerequisites], page 33).\\n\\n\\x0c32\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nPhony targets are also useful in conjunction with recursive invocations of make (see\\nSection 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56).\\nIn this situation the makefile will often\\ncontain a variable which lists a number of sub-directories to be built. A simplistic way to\\nhandle this is to define one rule with a recipe that loops over the sub-directories, like this:\\n\\nSUBDIRS = foo bar baz\\n\\nsubdirs:\\n\\nfor dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \\\\\\n\\n$(MAKE) -C $$dir; \\\\\\n\\ndone\\n\\nThere are problems with this method, however. First, any error detected in a sub-make\\nis ignored by this rule, so it will continue to build the rest of the directories even when one\\nfails. This can be overcome by adding shell commands to note the error and exit, but then\\nit will do so even if make is invoked with the -k option, which is unfortunate. Second, and\\nperhaps more importantly, you cannot take full advantage of make’s ability to build targets\\nin parallel (see Section 5.4 [Parallel Execution], page 51), since there is only one rule. Each\\nindividual makefile’s targets will be built in parallel, but only one sub-directory will be built\\nat a time.\\n\\nBy declaring the sub-directories as .PHONY targets (you must do this as the sub-directory\\n\\nobviously always exists; otherwise it won’t be built) you can remove these problems:\\n\\nSUBDIRS = foo bar baz\\n\\n.PHONY: subdirs $(SUBDIRS)\\n\\nsubdirs: $(SUBDIRS)\\n\\n$(SUBDIRS):\\n\\n$(MAKE) -C $@\\n\\nfoo: baz\\n\\nHere we’ve also declared that the foo sub-directory cannot be built until after the baz\\nsub-directory is complete; this kind of relationship declaration is particularly important\\nwhen attempting parallel builds.\\n\\nThe implicit rule search (see Chapter 10 [Implicit Rules], page 121) is skipped for .PHONY\\ntargets. This is why declaring a target as .PHONY is good for performance, even if you are\\nnot worried about the actual file existing.\\n\\nA phony target should not be a prerequisite of a real target file; if it is, its recipe will be\\nrun every time make considers that file. As long as a phony target is never a prerequisite\\nof a real target, the phony target recipe will be executed only when the phony target is a\\nspecified goal (see Section 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals], page 109).\\n\\nYou should not declare an included makefile as phony. Phony targets are not intended to\\nrepresent real files, and because the target is always considered out of date make will always\\nrebuild it then re-execute itself (see Section 3.5 [How Makefiles Are Remade], page 15). To\\navoid this, make will not re-execute itself if an included file marked as phony is re-built.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n33\\n\\nPhony targets can have prerequisites. When one directory contains multiple programs,\\nit is most convenient to describe all of the programs in one makefile ./Makefile. Since the\\ntarget remade by default will be the first one in the makefile, it is common to make this\\na phony target named ‘all’ and give it, as prerequisites, all the individual programs. For\\nexample:\\n\\nall : prog1 prog2 prog3\\n.PHONY : all\\n\\nprog1 : prog1.o utils.o\\n\\ncc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o\\n\\nprog2 : prog2.o\\n\\ncc -o prog2 prog2.o\\n\\nprog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o\\n\\ncc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o\\n\\nNow you can say just ‘make’ to remake all three programs, or specify as arguments the ones\\nto remake (as in ‘make prog1 prog3’). Phoniness is not inherited: the prerequisites of a\\nphony target are not themselves phony, unless explicitly declared to be so.\\n\\nWhen one phony target is a prerequisite of another, it serves as a subroutine of the other.\\nFor example, here ‘make cleanall’ will delete the object files, the difference files, and the\\nfile program:\\n\\n.PHONY: cleanall cleanobj cleandiff\\n\\ncleanall : cleanobj cleandiff\\n\\nrm program\\n\\ncleanobj :\\n\\nrm *.o\\n\\ncleandiff :\\n\\nrm *.diff\\n\\n4.6 Rules without Recipes or Prerequisites\\n\\nIf a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then\\nmake imagines this target to have been updated whenever its rule is run. This implies that\\nall targets depending on this one will always have their recipe run.\\n\\nAn example will illustrate this:\\n\\nclean: FORCE\\n\\nrm $(objects)\\n\\nFORCE:\\n\\nHere the target ‘FORCE’ satisfies the special conditions, so the target clean that depends\\non it is forced to run its recipe. There is nothing special about the name ‘FORCE’, but that\\nis one name commonly used this way.\\n\\n\\x0c34\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nAs you can see, using ‘FORCE’ this way has the same results as using ‘.PHONY: clean’.\\nUsing ‘.PHONY’ is more explicit and more efficient. However, other versions of make do\\nnot support ‘.PHONY’; thus ‘FORCE’ appears in many makefiles. See Section 4.5 [Phony\\nTargets], page 31.\\n\\n4.7 Empty Target Files to Record Events\\n\\nThe empty target is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold recipes for an action\\nthat you request explicitly from time to time. Unlike a phony target, this target file can\\nreally exist; but the file’s contents do not matter, and usually are empty.\\n\\nThe purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its last-modification time, when\\nthe rule’s recipe was last executed. It does so because one of the commands in the recipe\\nis a touch command to update the target file.\\n\\nThe empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it doesn’t make sense).\\nWhen you ask to remake the empty target, the recipe is executed if any prerequisite is more\\nrecent than the target; in other words, if a prerequisite has changed since the last time you\\nremade the target. Here is an example:\\n\\nprint: foo.c bar.c\\n\\nlpr -p $?\\ntouch print\\n\\nWith this rule, ‘make print’ will execute the lpr command if either source file has changed\\nsince the last ‘make print’. The automatic variable ‘$?’ is used to print only those files\\nthat have changed (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\n4.8 Special Built-in Target Names\\n\\nCertain names have special meanings if they appear as targets.\\n\\n.PHONY\\n\\n.SUFFIXES\\n\\n.DEFAULT\\n\\n.PRECIOUS\\n\\nThe prerequisites of the special target .PHONY are considered to be phony tar-\\ngets. When it is time to consider such a target, make will run its recipe un-\\nconditionally, regardless of whether a file with that name exists or what its\\nlast-modification time is. See Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31.\\n\\nThe prerequisites of the special target .SUFFIXES are the list of suffixes to be\\nused in checking for suffix rules. See Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules],\\npage 136.\\n\\nThe recipe specified for .DEFAULT is used for any target for which no rules are\\nfound (either explicit rules or implicit rules). See Section 10.6 [Last Resort],\\npage 135. If a .DEFAULT recipe is specified, every file mentioned as a prerequi-\\nsite, but not as a target in a rule, will have that recipe executed on its behalf.\\nSee Section 10.8 [Implicit Rule Search Algorithm], page 137.\\n\\nThe targets which .PRECIOUS depends on are given the following special treat-\\nment: if make is killed or interrupted during the execution of their recipes, the\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n35\\n\\ntarget is not deleted. See Section 5.6 [Interrupting or Killing make], page 55.\\nAlso, if the target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no\\nlonger needed, as is normally done. See Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules],\\npage 127. In this latter respect it overlaps with the .SECONDARY special target.\\n\\nYou can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as ‘%.o’) as a\\nprerequisite file of the special target .PRECIOUS to preserve intermediate files\\ncreated by rules whose target patterns match that file’s name.\\n\\n.INTERMEDIATE\\n\\nThe targets which .INTERMEDIATE depends on are treated as intermediate files.\\nSee Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127. .INTERMEDIATE with no\\nprerequisites has no effect.\\n\\n.NOTINTERMEDIATE\\n\\nPrerequisites of the special target .NOTINTERMEDIATE are never considered\\nSee Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127.\\nintermediate files.\\n.NOTINTERMEDIATE with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated as\\nnot intermediate.\\n\\nIf the prerequisite is a target pattern then targets that are built using that\\npattern rule are not considered intermediate.\\n\\n.SECONDARY\\n\\nThe targets which .SECONDARY depends on are treated as intermediate files,\\nexcept that they are never automatically deleted. See Section 10.4 [Chains of\\nImplicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\n.SECONDARY can be used to avoid redundant rebuilds in some unusual situations.\\nFor example:\\n\\nhello.bin: hello.o bye.o\\n\\n$(CC) -o $@ $^\\n\\n%.o: %.c\\n\\n$(CC) -c -o $@ $<\\n\\n.SECONDARY: hello.o bye.o\\n\\nSuppose hello.bin is up to date in regards to the source files, but the object\\nfile hello.o is missing. Without .SECONDARY make would rebuild hello.o then\\nrebuild hello.bin even though the source files had not changed. By declaring\\nhello.o as .SECONDARY make will not need to rebuild it and won’t need to\\nrebuild hello.bin either. Of course, if one of the source files were updated\\nthen all object files would be rebuilt so that the creation of hello.bin could\\nsucceed.\\n\\n.SECONDARY with no prerequisites causes all targets to be treated as secondary\\n(i.e., no target is removed because it is considered intermediate).\\n\\n.SECONDEXPANSION\\n\\nIf .SECONDEXPANSION is mentioned as a target anywhere in the makefile, then\\nall prerequisite lists defined after it appears will be expanded a second time\\n\\n\\x0c36\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nafter all makefiles have been read in. See Section 3.9 [Secondary Expansion],\\npage 19.\\n\\n.DELETE_ON_ERROR\\n\\nIf .DELETE_ON_ERROR is mentioned as a target anywhere in the makefile, then\\nmake will delete the target of a rule if it has changed and its recipe exits with\\na nonzero exit status, just as it does when it receives a signal. See Section 5.5\\n[Errors in Recipes], page 54.\\n\\n.IGNORE\\n\\nIf you specify prerequisites for .IGNORE, then make will ignore errors in execution\\nof the recipe for those particular files. The recipe for .IGNORE (if any) is ignored.\\nIf mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, .IGNORE says to ignore errors in\\nexecution of recipes for all files. This usage of ‘.IGNORE’ is supported only for\\nhistorical compatibility. Since this affects every recipe in the makefile, it is not\\nvery useful; we recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in\\nspecific recipes. See Section 5.5 [Errors in Recipes], page 54.\\n\\n.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME\\n\\nIf you specify prerequisites for .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME, make assumes that\\nthese files are created by commands that generate low resolution time stamps.\\nThe recipe for the .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME target are ignored.\\nThe high resolution file time stamps of many modern file systems lessen the\\nchance of make incorrectly concluding that a file is up to date. Unfortunately,\\nsome hosts do not provide a way to set a high resolution file time stamp, so\\ncommands like ‘cp -p’ that explicitly set a file’s time stamp must discard its\\nsub-second part.\\nIf a file is created by such a command, you should list it\\nas a prerequisite of .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME so that make does not mistakenly\\nconclude that the file is out of date. For example:\\n\\n.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME: dst\\ndst: src\\n\\ncp -p src dst\\n\\nSince ‘cp -p’ discards the sub-second part of src’s time stamp, dst is typically\\nslightly older than src even when it is up to date. The .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME\\nline causes make to consider dst to be up to date if its time stamp is at the\\nstart of the same second that src’s time stamp is in.\\nDue to a limitation of the archive format, archive member time stamps are\\nalways low resolution. You need not list archive members as prerequisites of\\n.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME, as make does this automatically.\\n\\nIf you specify prerequisites for .SILENT, then make will not print the recipe used\\nto remake those particular files before executing them. The recipe for .SILENT\\nis ignored.\\nIf mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, .SILENT says not to print any\\nrecipes before executing them. You may also use more selective ways to silence\\nspecific recipe command lines. See Section 5.2 [Recipe Echoing], page 47. If\\n\\n.SILENT\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n37\\n\\nyou want to silence all recipes for a particular run of make, use the ‘-s’ or\\n‘--silent’ option (see Section 9.8 [Options Summary], page 114).\\n\\n.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES\\n\\nSimply by being mentioned as a target, this tells make to export all variables\\nto child processes by default. This is an alternative to using export with\\nno arguments. See Section 5.7.2 [Communicating Variables to a Sub-make],\\npage 57.\\n\\n.NOTPARALLEL\\n\\nIf .NOTPARALLEL is mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, all targets in\\nthis invocation of make will be run serially, even if the ‘-j’ option is given. Any\\nrecursively invoked make command will still run recipes in parallel (unless its\\nmakefile also contains this target).\\nIf .NOTPARALLEL has targets as prerequisites, then all the prerequisites of those\\ntargets will be run serially. This implicitly adds a .WAIT between each pre-\\nrequisite of the listed targets. See Section 5.4.1 [Disabling Parallel Execution],\\npage 51.\\n\\n.ONESHELL\\n\\n.POSIX\\n\\nIf .ONESHELL is mentioned as a target, then when a target is built all lines of\\nthe recipe will be given to a single invocation of the shell rather than each line\\nbeing invoked separately. See Section 5.3 [Recipe Execution], page 48.\\n\\nIf .POSIX is mentioned as a target, then the makefile will be parsed and run\\nin POSIX-conforming mode. This does not mean that only POSIX-conforming\\nmakefiles will be accepted: all advanced GNU make features are still available.\\nRather, this target causes make to behave as required by POSIX in those areas\\nwhere make’s default behavior differs.\\nIn particular, if this target is mentioned then recipes will be invoked as if the\\nshell had been passed the -e flag: the first failing command in a recipe will\\ncause the recipe to fail immediately.\\n\\nAny defined implicit rule suffix also counts as a special target if it appears as a target,\\nand so does the concatenation of two suffixes, such as ‘.c.o’. These targets are suffix rules,\\nan obsolete way of defining implicit rules (but a way still widely used). In principle, any\\ntarget name could be special in this way if you break it in two and add both pieces to the\\nsuffix list. In practice, suffixes normally begin with ‘.’, so these special target names also\\nbegin with ‘.’. See Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules], page 136.\\n\\n4.9 Multiple Targets in a Rule\\n\\nWhen an explicit rule has multiple targets they can be treated in one of two possible ways:\\nas independent targets or as grouped targets. The manner in which they are treated is\\ndetermined by the separator that appears after the list of targets.\\n\\nRules with Independent Targets\\nRules that use the standard target separator, :, define independent targets. This is equiva-\\nlent to writing the same rule once for each target, with duplicated prerequisites and recipes.\\n\\n\\x0c38\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nTypically, the recipe would use automatic variables such as ‘$@’ to specify which target is\\nbeing built.\\n\\nRules with independent targets are useful in two cases:\\n\\n• You want just prerequisites, no recipe. For example:\\n\\nkbd.o command.o files.o: command.h\\n\\ngives an additional prerequisite to each of the three object files mentioned. It is equiv-\\nalent to writing:\\n\\nkbd.o: command.h\\ncommand.o: command.h\\nfiles.o: command.h\\n\\n• Similar recipes work for all the targets. The automatic variable ‘$@’ can be used to\\nsubstitute the particular target to be remade into the commands (see Section 10.5.3\\n[Automatic Variables], page 130). For example:\\n\\nbigoutput littleoutput : text.g\\n\\ngenerate text.g -$(subst output,,$@) > $@\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\nbigoutput : text.g\\n\\ngenerate text.g -big > bigoutput\\n\\nlittleoutput : text.g\\n\\ngenerate text.g -little > littleoutput\\n\\nHere we assume the hypothetical program generate makes two types of output, one if\\ngiven ‘-big’ and one if given ‘-little’. See Section 8.2 [Functions for String Substi-\\ntution and Analysis], page 92, for an explanation of the subst function.\\n\\nSuppose you would like to vary the prerequisites according to the target, much as the\\nvariable ‘$@’ allows you to vary the recipe. You cannot do this with multiple targets in an\\nordinary rule, but you can do it with a static pattern rule. See Section 4.11 [Static Pattern\\nRules], page 40.\\n\\nRules with Grouped Targets\\nIf instead of independent targets you have a recipe that generates multiple files from a single\\ninvocation, you can express that relationship by declaring your rule to use grouped targets.\\nA grouped target rule uses the separator &: (the ‘&’ here is used to imply “all”).\\n\\nWhen make builds any one of the grouped targets, it understands that all the other\\ntargets in the group are also updated as a result of the invocation of the recipe. Furthermore,\\nif only some of the grouped targets are out of date or missing make will realize that running\\nthe recipe will update all of the targets. Finally, if any of the grouped targets are out of\\ndate, all the grouped targets are considered out of date.\\n\\nAs an example, this rule defines a grouped target:\\n\\nfoo bar biz &: baz boz\\n\\necho $^ > foo\\necho $^ > bar\\necho $^ > biz\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n39\\n\\nDuring the execution of a grouped target’s recipe, the automatic variable ‘$@’ is set to\\nthe name of the particular target in the group which triggered the rule. Caution must be\\nused if relying on this variable in the recipe of a grouped target rule.\\n\\nUnlike independent targets, a grouped target rule must include a recipe. However,\\ntargets that are members of a grouped target may also appear in independent target rule\\ndefinitions that do not have recipes.\\n\\nEach target may have only one recipe associated with it. If a grouped target appears in\\neither an independent target rule or in another grouped target rule with a recipe, you will\\nget a warning and the latter recipe will replace the former recipe. Additionally the target\\nwill be removed from the previous group and appear only in the new group.\\n\\nIf you would like a target to appear in multiple groups, then you must use the double-\\ncolon grouped target separator, &:: when declaring all of the groups containing that target.\\nGrouped double-colon targets are each considered independently, and each grouped double-\\ncolon rule’s recipe is executed at most once, if at least one of its multiple targets requires\\nupdating.\\n\\n4.10 Multiple Rules for One Target\\n\\nOne file can be the target of several rules. All the prerequisites mentioned in all the rules\\nare merged into one list of prerequisites for the target.\\nIf the target is older than any\\nprerequisite from any rule, the recipe is executed.\\n\\nThere can only be one recipe to be executed for a file. If more than one rule gives a\\nrecipe for the same file, make uses the last one given and prints an error message. (As a\\nspecial case, if the file’s name begins with a dot, no error message is printed. This odd\\nbehavior is only for compatibility with other implementations of make. . . you should avoid\\nusing it). Occasionally it is useful to have the same target invoke multiple recipes which are\\ndefined in different parts of your makefile; you can use double-colon rules (see Section 4.12\\n[Double-Colon], page 42) for this.\\n\\nAn extra rule with just prerequisites can be used to give a few extra prerequisites to many\\nfiles at once. For example, makefiles often have a variable, such as objects, containing a\\nlist of all the compiler output files in the system being made. An easy way to say that all\\nof them must be recompiled if config.h changes is to write the following:\\n\\nobjects = foo.o bar.o\\nfoo.o : defs.h\\nbar.o : defs.h test.h\\n$(objects) : config.h\\n\\nThis could be inserted or taken out without changing the rules that really specify how to\\nmake the object files, making it a convenient form to use if you wish to add the additional\\nprerequisite intermittently.\\n\\nAnother wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be specified with a variable\\nthat you set with a command line argument to make (see Section 9.5 [Overriding Variables],\\npage 113). For example,\\n\\nextradeps=\\n$(objects) : $(extradeps)\\n\\n\\x0c40\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nmeans that the command ‘make extradeps=foo.h’ will consider foo.h as a prerequisite of\\neach object file, but plain ‘make’ will not.\\n\\nIf none of the explicit rules for a target has a recipe, then make searches for an applicable\\n\\nimplicit rule to find one see Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules], page 121).\\n\\n4.11 Static Pattern Rules\\n\\nStatic pattern rules are rules which specify multiple targets and construct the prerequisite\\nnames for each target based on the target name. They are more general than ordinary rules\\nwith multiple targets because the targets do not have to have identical prerequisites. Their\\nprerequisites must be analogous, but not necessarily identical.\\n\\n4.11.1 Syntax of Static Pattern Rules\\nHere is the syntax of a static pattern rule:\\n\\ntargets ...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...\\n\\nrecipe\\n...\\n\\nThe targets list specifies the targets that the rule applies to. The targets can contain\\nwildcard characters, just like the targets of ordinary rules (see Section 4.3 [Using Wildcard\\nCharacters in File Names], page 25).\\n\\nThe target-pattern and prereq-patterns say how to compute the prerequisites of each\\ntarget. Each target is matched against the target-pattern to extract a part of the target\\nname, called the stem. This stem is substituted into each of the prereq-patterns to make\\nthe prerequisite names (one from each prereq-pattern).\\n\\nEach pattern normally contains the character ‘%’ just once. When the target-pattern\\nmatches a target, the ‘%’ can match any part of the target name; this part is called the\\nstem. The rest of the pattern must match exactly. For example, the target foo.o matches\\nthe pattern ‘%.o’, with ‘foo’ as the stem. The targets foo.c and foo.out do not match\\nthat pattern.\\n\\nThe prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the stem for the ‘%’ in\\neach prerequisite pattern. For example, if one prerequisite pattern is %.c, then substitution\\nof the stem ‘foo’ gives the prerequisite name foo.c. It is legitimate to write a prerequisite\\npattern that does not contain ‘%’; then this prerequisite is the same for all targets.\\n\\n‘%’ characters in pattern rules can be quoted with preceding backslashes (‘\\\\’). Back-\\nslashes that would otherwise quote ‘%’ characters can be quoted with more backslashes.\\nBackslashes that quote ‘%’ characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern\\nbefore it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that\\nare not in danger of quoting ‘%’ characters go unmolested. For example, the pattern\\nthe\\\\%weird\\\\\\\\%pattern\\\\\\\\ has ‘the%weird\\\\’ preceding the operative ‘%’ character, and\\n‘pattern\\\\\\\\’ following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot\\naffect any ‘%’ character.\\n\\nHere is an example, which compiles each of foo.o and bar.o from the corresponding .c\\n\\nfile:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n41\\n\\nobjects = foo.o bar.o\\n\\nall: $(objects)\\n\\n$(objects): %.o: %.c\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\nHere ‘$<’ is the automatic variable that holds the name of the prerequisite and ‘$@’ is\\nthe automatic variable that holds the name of the target; see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic\\nVariables], page 130.\\n\\nEach target specified must match the target pattern; a warning is issued for each target\\nthat does not. If you have a list of files, only some of which will match the pattern, you can\\nuse the filter function to remove non-matching file names (see Section 8.2 [Functions for\\nString Substitution and Analysis], page 92):\\n\\nfiles = foo.elc bar.o lose.o\\n\\n$(filter %.o,$(files)): %.o: %.c\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\n$(filter %.elc,$(files)): %.elc: %.el\\n\\nemacs -f batch-byte-compile $<\\n\\nIn this example the result of ‘$(filter %.o,$(files))’ is bar.o lose.o, and the first static\\npattern rule causes each of these object files to be updated by compiling the corresponding\\nC source file. The result of ‘$(filter %.elc,$(files))’ is foo.elc, so that file is made\\nfrom foo.el.\\n\\nAnother example shows how to use $* in static pattern rules:\\n\\nbigoutput littleoutput : %output : text.g\\ngenerate text.g -$* > $@\\n\\nWhen the generate command is run, $* will expand to the stem, either ‘big’ or ‘little’.\\n\\n4.11.2 Static Pattern Rules versus Implicit Rules\\nA static pattern rule has much in common with an implicit rule defined as a pattern rule\\n(see Section 10.5 [Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules], page 129). Both have a pattern\\nfor the target and patterns for constructing the names of prerequisites. The difference is in\\nhow make decides when the rule applies.\\n\\nAn implicit rule can apply to any target that matches its pattern, but it does apply\\nonly when the target has no recipe otherwise specified, and only when the prerequisites can\\nbe found. If more than one implicit rule appears applicable, only one applies; the choice\\ndepends on the order of rules.\\n\\nBy contrast, a static pattern rule applies to the precise list of targets that you specify\\nin the rule. It cannot apply to any other target and it invariably does apply to each of the\\ntargets specified. If two conflicting rules apply, and both have recipes, that’s an error.\\n\\nThe static pattern rule can be better than an implicit rule for these reasons:\\n\\n• You may wish to override the usual implicit rule for a few files whose names cannot be\\n\\ncategorized syntactically but can be given in an explicit list.\\n\\n\\x0c42\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n• If you cannot be sure of the precise contents of the directories you are using, you may\\nnot be sure which other irrelevant files might lead make to use the wrong implicit rule.\\nThe choice might depend on the order in which the implicit rule search is done. With\\nstatic pattern rules, there is no uncertainty: each rule applies to precisely the targets\\nspecified.\\n\\n4.12 Double-Colon Rules\\n\\nDouble-colon rules are explicit rules written with ‘::’ instead of ‘:’ after the target names.\\nThey are handled differently from ordinary rules when the same target appears in more\\nthan one rule. Pattern rules with double-colons have an entirely different meaning (see\\nSection 10.5.5 [Match-Anything Rules], page 134).\\n\\nWhen a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the same type: all ordinary,\\nor all double-colon. If they are double-colon, each of them is independent of the others.\\nEach double-colon rule’s recipe is executed if the target is older than any prerequisites of\\nthat rule. If there are no prerequisites for that rule, its recipe is always executed (even if\\nthe target already exists). This can result in executing none, any, or all of the double-colon\\nrules.\\n\\nDouble-colon rules with the same target are in fact completely separate from one another.\\nEach double-colon rule is processed individually, just as rules with different targets are\\nprocessed.\\n\\nThe double-colon rules for a target are executed in the order they appear in the makefile.\\nHowever, the cases where double-colon rules really make sense are those where the order of\\nexecuting the recipes would not matter.\\n\\nDouble-colon rules are somewhat obscure and not often very useful; they provide a\\nmechanism for cases in which the method used to update a target differs depending on\\nwhich prerequisite files caused the update, and such cases are rare.\\n\\nEach double-colon rule should specify a recipe; if it does not, an implicit rule will be\\n\\nused if one applies. See Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules], page 121.\\n\\n4.13 Generating Prerequisites Automatically\\n\\nIn the makefile for a program, many of the rules you need to write often say only that\\nsome object file depends on some header file. For example, if main.c uses defs.h via an\\n#include, you would write:\\nmain.o: defs.h\\n\\nYou need this rule so that make knows that it must remake main.o whenever defs.h\\nchanges. You can see that for a large program you would have to write dozens of such rules\\nin your makefile. And, you must always be very careful to update the makefile every time\\nyou add or remove an #include.\\n\\nTo avoid this hassle, most modern C compilers can write these rules for you, by looking\\nat the #include lines in the source files. Usually this is done with the ‘-M’ option to the\\ncompiler. For example, the command:\\n\\ncc -M main.c\\ngenerates the output:\\n\\nmain.o : main.c defs.h\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 4: Writing Rules\\n\\n43\\n\\nThus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself. The compiler will do it for you.\\nNote that such a rule constitutes mentioning main.o in a makefile, so it can never be\\nconsidered an intermediate file by implicit rule search. This means that make won’t ever\\nremove the file after using it; see Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\nWith old make programs, it was traditional practice to use this compiler feature to\\ngenerate prerequisites on demand with a command like ‘make depend’. That command\\nwould create a file depend containing all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then\\nthe makefile could use include to read them in (see Section 3.3 [Include], page 13).\\n\\nIn GNU make, the feature of remaking makefiles makes this practice obsolete—you need\\nnever tell make explicitly to regenerate the prerequisites, because it always regenerates any\\nmakefile that is out of date. See Section 3.5 [Remaking Makefiles], page 15.\\n\\nThe practice we recommend for automatic prerequisite generation is to have one makefile\\ncorresponding to each source file. For each source file name.c there is a makefile name.d\\nwhich lists what files the object file name.o depends on. That way only the source files that\\nhave changed need to be rescanned to produce the new prerequisites.\\n\\nHere is the pattern rule to generate a file of prerequisites (i.e., a makefile) called name.d\\n\\nfrom a C source file called name.c:\\n\\n%.d: %.c\\n\\n@set -e; rm -f $@; \\\\\\n\\n$(CC) -M $(CPPFLAGS) $< > $@.$$$$; \\\\\\nsed ’s,\\\\($*\\\\)\\\\.o[ :]*,\\\\1.o $@ : ,g’ < $@.$$$$ > $@; \\\\\\nrm -f $@.$$$$\\n\\nSee Section 10.5 [Pattern Rules], page 129, for information on defining pattern rules. The\\n‘-e’ flag to the shell causes it to exit immediately if the $(CC) command (or any other\\ncommand) fails (exits with a nonzero status).\\n\\nWith the GNU C compiler, you may wish to use the ‘-MM’ flag instead of ‘-M’. This omits\\nprerequisites on system header files. See Section “Options Controlling the Preprocessor” in\\nUsing GNU CC, for details.\\n\\nThe purpose of the sed command is to translate (for example):\\n\\nmain.o : main.c defs.h\\n\\ninto:\\n\\nmain.o main.d : main.c defs.h\\n\\nThis makes each ‘.d’ file depend on all the source and header files that the corresponding\\n‘.o’ file depends on. make then knows it must regenerate the prerequisites whenever any of\\nthe source or header files changes.\\n\\nOnce you’ve defined the rule to remake the ‘.d’ files, you then use the include directive\\n\\nto read them all in. See Section 3.3 [Include], page 13. For example:\\n\\nsources = foo.c bar.c\\n\\ninclude $(sources:.c=.d)\\n\\n(This example uses a substitution variable reference to translate the list of source files ‘foo.c\\nbar.c’ into a list of prerequisite makefiles, ‘foo.d bar.d’. See Section 6.3.1 [Substitution\\nRefs], page 69, for full information on substitution references.) Since the ‘.d’ files are\\nmakefiles like any others, make will remake them as necessary with no further work from\\nyou. See Section 3.5 [Remaking Makefiles], page 15.\\n\\n\\x0c44\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nNote that the ‘.d’ files contain target definitions; you should be sure to place the include\\ndirective after the first, default goal in your makefiles or run the risk of having a random\\nobject file become the default goal. See Section 2.3 [How Make Works], page 5.\\n\\n\\x0c45\\n\\n5 Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\nThe recipe of a rule consists of one or more shell command lines to be executed, one at a\\ntime, in the order they appear. Typically, the result of executing these commands is that\\nthe target of the rule is brought up to date.\\n\\nUsers use many different shell programs, but recipes in makefiles are always interpreted\\nby /bin/sh unless the makefile specifies otherwise. See Section 5.3 [Recipe Execution],\\npage 48.\\n\\n5.1 Recipe Syntax\\n\\nMakefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct syntaxes in one\\nfile. Most of the makefile uses make syntax (see Chapter 3 [Writing Makefiles], page 11).\\nHowever, recipes are meant to be interpreted by the shell and so they are written using\\nshell syntax. The make program does not try to understand shell syntax: it performs only\\na very few specific translations on the content of the recipe before handing it to the shell.\\n\\nEach line in the recipe must start with a tab (or the first character in the value of the\\n.RECIPEPREFIX variable; see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80), except that the first\\nrecipe line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between.\\nAny line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a “rule context” (that is,\\nafter a rule has been started until another rule or variable definition) will be considered\\npart of a recipe for that rule. Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear among\\nthe recipe lines; they are ignored.\\n\\nSome consequences of these rules include:\\n\\n• A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it’s an empty recipe (see Section 5.9\\n\\n[Empty Recipes], page 62).\\n\\n• A comment in a recipe is not a make comment; it will be passed to the shell as-is.\\n\\nWhether the shell treats it as a comment or not depends on your shell.\\n\\n• A variable definition in a “rule context” which is indented by a tab as the first character\\non the line, will be considered part of a recipe, not a make variable definition, and passed\\nto the shell.\\n\\n• A conditional expression (ifdef, ifeq, etc. see Section 7.2 [Syntax of Conditionals],\\npage 86) in a “rule context” which is indented by a tab as the first character on the\\nline, will be considered part of a recipe and be passed to the shell.\\n\\n5.1.1 Splitting Recipe Lines\\nOne of the few ways in which make does interpret recipes is checking for a backslash just\\nbefore the newline. As in normal makefile syntax, a single logical recipe line can be split\\ninto multiple physical lines in the makefile by placing a backslash before each newline. A\\nsequence of lines like this is considered a single recipe line, and one instance of the shell will\\nbe invoked to run it.\\n\\nHowever,\\n\\nin contrast to how they are treated in other places in a makefile (see\\nSection 3.1.1 [Splitting Long Lines], page 12), backslash/newline pairs are not removed\\nfrom the recipe. Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved and passed\\nto the shell. How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your shell. If the first\\n\\n\\x0c46\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ncharacter of the next line after the backslash/newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab\\nby default; see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80), then that character (and only\\nthat character) is removed. Whitespace is never added to the recipe.\\n\\nFor example, the recipe for the all target in this makefile:\\n\\nall :\\n\\nspace\\n\\n@echo no\\\\\\n\\n@echo no\\\\\\nspace\\n@echo one \\\\\\nspace\\n@echo one\\\\\\n\\nspace\\n\\nconsists of four separate shell commands where the output is:\\n\\nnospace\\nnospace\\none space\\none space\\n\\nAs a more complex example, this makefile:\\n\\nall : ; @echo ’hello \\\\\\n\\nworld’ ; echo \"hello \\\\\\n\\nworld\"\\n\\nwill invoke one shell with a command of:\\n\\necho ’hello \\\\\\nworld’ ; echo \"hello \\\\\\n\\nworld\"\\n\\nwhich, according to shell quoting rules, will yield the following output:\\n\\nhello \\\\\\nworld\\nhello\\n\\nworld\\n\\nNotice how the backslash/newline pair was removed inside the string quoted with double\\nquotes (\"...\"), but not from the string quoted with single quotes (’...’). This is the way\\nthe default shell (/bin/sh) handles backslash/newline pairs. If you specify a different shell\\nin your makefiles it may treat them differently.\\n\\nSometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you don’t want the\\nbackslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing\\nscripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change\\nits meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the\\nquoted string, or even the entire command, into a make variable then use the variable in\\nthe recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the\\nbackslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method:\\n\\nHELLO = ’hello \\\\\\nworld’\\n\\nall : ; @echo $(HELLO)\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n47\\n\\nwe will get output like this:\\n\\nhello world\\n\\nIf you like, you can also use target-specific variables (see Section 6.11 [Target-specific\\nVariable Values], page 78) to obtain a tighter correspondence between the variable and the\\nrecipe that uses it.\\n\\n5.1.2 Using Variables in Recipes\\nThe other way in which make processes recipes is by expanding any variable references in\\nthem (see Section 6.1 [Reference], page 65). This occurs after make has finished reading\\nall the makefiles and the target is determined to be out of date; so, the recipes for targets\\nwhich are not rebuilt are never expanded.\\n\\nVariable and function references in recipes have identical syntax and semantics to ref-\\nif you want a\\nerences elsewhere in the makefile. They also have the same quoting rules:\\ndollar sign to appear in your recipe, you must double it (‘$$’). For shells like the default\\nshell, that use dollar signs to introduce variables, it’s important to keep clear in your mind\\nwhether the variable you want to reference is a make variable (use a single dollar sign) or a\\nshell variable (use two dollar signs). For example:\\n\\nLIST = one two three\\nall:\\n\\nfor i in $(LIST); do \\\\\\n\\necho $$i; \\\\\\n\\ndone\\n\\nresults in the following command being passed to the shell:\\n\\nfor i in one two three; do \\\\\\n\\necho $i; \\\\\\n\\ndone\\n\\nwhich generates the expected result:\\n\\none\\ntwo\\nthree\\n\\n5.2 Recipe Echoing\\n\\nNormally make prints each line of the recipe before it is executed. We call this echoing\\nbecause it gives the appearance that you are typing the lines yourself.\\n\\nWhen a line starts with ‘@’, the echoing of that line is suppressed. The ‘@’ is discarded\\nbefore the line is passed to the shell. Typically you would use this for a command whose\\nonly effect is to print something, such as an echo command to indicate progress through\\nthe makefile:\\n\\n@echo About to make distribution files\\n\\nWhen make is given the flag ‘-n’ or ‘--just-print’ it only echoes most recipes, without\\nexecuting them. See Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114. In this case even the\\nrecipe lines starting with ‘@’ are printed. This flag is useful for finding out which recipes\\nmake thinks are necessary without actually doing them.\\n\\n\\x0c48\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThe ‘-s’ or ‘--silent’ flag to make prevents all echoing, as if all recipes started with\\n‘@’. A rule in the makefile for the special target .SILENT without prerequisites has the same\\neffect (see Section 4.8 [Special Built-in Target Names], page 34).\\n\\n5.3 Recipe Execution\\n\\nWhen it is time to execute recipes to update a target, they are executed by invoking a new\\nsub-shell for each line of the recipe, unless the .ONESHELL special target is in effect (see\\nSection 5.3.1 [Using One Shell], page 48) (In practice, make may take shortcuts that do not\\naffect the results.)\\n\\nPlease note: this implies that setting shell variables and invoking shell commands such\\nas cd that set a context local to each process will not affect the following lines in the recipe.1\\nIf you want to use cd to affect the next statement, put both statements in a single recipe\\nline. Then make will invoke one shell to run the entire line, and the shell will execute the\\nstatements in sequence. For example:\\n\\nfoo : bar/lose\\n\\ncd $(<D) && gobble $(<F) > ../$@\\n\\nHere we use the shell AND operator (&&) so that if the cd command fails, the script will fail\\nwithout trying to invoke the gobble command in the wrong directory, which could cause\\nproblems (in this case it would certainly cause ../foo to be truncated, at least).\\n\\n5.3.1 Using One Shell\\nSometimes you would prefer that all the lines in the recipe be passed to a single invocation\\nof the shell. There are generally two situations where this is useful: first, it can improve\\nperformance in makefiles where recipes consist of many command lines, by avoiding extra\\nprocesses. Second, you might want newlines to be included in your recipe command (for\\nexample perhaps you are using a very different interpreter as your SHELL). If the .ONESHELL\\nspecial target appears anywhere in the makefile then all recipe lines for each target will be\\nprovided to a single invocation of the shell. Newlines between recipe lines will be preserved.\\nFor example:\\n\\n.ONESHELL:\\nfoo : bar/lose\\n\\ncd $(<D)\\ngobble $(<F) > ../$@\\n\\nwould now work as expected even though the commands are on different recipe lines.\\n\\nIf .ONESHELL is provided, then only the first line of the recipe will be checked for the\\nspecial prefix characters (‘@’, ‘-’, and ‘+’). Subsequent lines will include the special char-\\nacters in the recipe line when the SHELL is invoked. If you want your recipe to start with\\none of these special characters you’ll need to arrange for them to not be the first characters\\non the first line, perhaps by adding a comment or similar. For example, this would be a\\nsyntax error in Perl because the first ‘@’ is removed by make:\\n\\n.ONESHELL:\\nSHELL = /usr/bin/perl\\n\\n1 On MS-DOS, the value of current working directory is global, so changing it will affect the following\\n\\nrecipe lines on those systems.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n49\\n\\n.SHELLFLAGS = -e\\nshow :\\n\\n@f = qw(a b c);\\nprint \"@f\\\\n\";\\n\\nHowever, either of these alternatives would work properly:\\n\\n.ONESHELL:\\nSHELL = /usr/bin/perl\\n.SHELLFLAGS = -e\\nshow :\\n\\n# Make sure \"@\" is not the first character on the first line\\n@f = qw(a b c);\\nprint \"@f\\\\n\";\\n\\nor\\n\\n.ONESHELL:\\nSHELL = /usr/bin/perl\\n.SHELLFLAGS = -e\\nshow :\\n\\nmy @f = qw(a b c);\\nprint \"@f\\\\n\";\\n\\nAs a special feature, if SHELL is determined to be a POSIX-style shell, the special prefix\\ncharacters in “internal” recipe lines will be removed before the recipe is processed. This\\nfeature is intended to allow existing makefiles to add the .ONESHELL special target and still\\nrun properly without extensive modifications. Since the special prefix characters are not\\nlegal at the beginning of a line in a POSIX shell script this is not a loss in functionality.\\nFor example, this works as expected:\\n\\n.ONESHELL:\\nfoo : bar/lose\\n\\n@cd $(@D)\\n@gobble $(@F) > ../$@\\n\\nEven with this special feature, however, makefiles with .ONESHELL will behave differently\\nin ways that could be noticeable. For example, normally if any line in the recipe fails, that\\ncauses the rule to fail and no more recipe lines are processed. Under .ONESHELL a failure\\nof any but the final recipe line will not be noticed by make. You can modify .SHELLFLAGS\\nto add the -e option to the shell which will cause any failure anywhere in the command\\nline to cause the shell to fail, but this could itself cause your recipe to behave differently.\\nUltimately you may need to harden your recipe lines to allow them to work with .ONESHELL.\\n\\n5.3.2 Choosing the Shell\\nThe program used as the shell is taken from the variable SHELL. If this variable is not set\\nin your makefile, the program /bin/sh is used as the shell. The argument(s) passed to the\\nshell are taken from the variable .SHELLFLAGS. The default value of .SHELLFLAGS is -c\\nnormally, or -ec in POSIX-conforming mode.\\n\\nUnlike most variables, the variable SHELL is never set from the environment. This is\\nbecause the SHELL environment variable is used to specify your personal choice of shell\\n\\n\\x0c50\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nprogram for interactive use. It would be very bad for personal choices like this to affect the\\nfunctioning of makefiles. See Section 6.10 [Variables from the Environment], page 77.\\n\\nFurthermore, when you do set SHELL in your makefile that value is not exported in the\\nenvironment to recipe lines that make invokes. Instead, the value inherited from the user’s\\nenvironment, if any, is exported. You can override this behavior by explicitly exporting\\nSHELL (see Section 5.7.2 [Communicating Variables to a Sub-make], page 57), forcing it to\\nbe passed in the environment to recipe lines.\\n\\nHowever, on MS-DOS and MS-Windows the value of SHELL in the environment is used,\\nsince on those systems most users do not set this variable, and therefore it is most likely\\nset specifically to be used by make. On MS-DOS, if the setting of SHELL is not suitable for\\nmake, you can set the variable MAKESHELL to the shell that make should use; if set it will be\\nused as the shell instead of the value of SHELL.\\n\\nChoosing a Shell in DOS and Windows\\nChoosing a shell in MS-DOS and MS-Windows is much more complex than on other systems.\\nOn MS-DOS, if SHELL is not set, the value of the variable COMSPEC (which is always set)\\n\\nis used instead.\\n\\nThe processing of lines that set the variable SHELL in Makefiles is different on MS-DOS.\\nThe stock shell, command.com, is ridiculously limited in its functionality and many users of\\nmake tend to install a replacement shell. Therefore, on MS-DOS, make examines the value\\nof SHELL, and changes its behavior based on whether it points to a Unix-style or DOS-style\\nshell. This allows reasonable functionality even if SHELL points to command.com.\\n\\nIf SHELL points to a Unix-style shell, make on MS-DOS additionally checks whether that\\nshell can indeed be found; if not, it ignores the line that sets SHELL. In MS-DOS, GNU\\nmake searches for the shell in the following places:\\n\\n1. In the precise place pointed to by the value of SHELL. For example, if the makefile\\nspecifies ‘SHELL = /bin/sh’, make will look in the directory /bin on the current drive.\\n\\n2. In the current directory.\\n3. In each of the directories in the PATH variable, in order.\\n\\nIn every directory it examines, make will first look for the specific file (sh in the example\\nabove). If this is not found, it will also look in that directory for that file with one of the\\nknown extensions which identify executable files. For example .exe, .com, .bat, .btm, .sh,\\nand some others.\\n\\nIf any of these attempts is successful, the value of SHELL will be set to the full pathname\\nof the shell as found. However, if none of these is found, the value of SHELL will not be\\nchanged, and thus the line that sets it will be effectively ignored. This is so make will only\\nsupport features specific to a Unix-style shell if such a shell is actually installed on the\\nsystem where make runs.\\n\\nNote that this extended search for the shell is limited to the cases where SHELL is set\\nfrom the Makefile; if it is set in the environment or command line, you are expected to set\\nit to the full pathname of the shell, exactly as things are on Unix.\\n\\nThe effect of the above DOS-specific processing is that a Makefile that contains ‘SHELL\\n= /bin/sh’ (as many Unix makefiles do), will work on MS-DOS unaltered if you have e.g.\\nsh.exe installed in some directory along your PATH.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n51\\n\\n5.4 Parallel Execution\\n\\nGNU make knows how to execute several recipes at once. Normally, make will execute\\nonly one recipe at a time, waiting for it to finish before executing the next. However, the\\n‘-j’ or ‘--jobs’ option tells make to execute many recipes simultaneously. You can inhibit\\nparallelism for some or all targets from within the makefile (see Section 5.4.1 [Disabling\\nParallel Execution], page 51).\\n\\nOn MS-DOS, the ‘-j’ option has no effect, since that system doesn’t support multi-\\n\\nprocessing.\\n\\nIf the ‘-j’ option is followed by an integer, this is the number of recipes to execute at\\nonce; this is called the number of job slots. If there is nothing looking like an integer after\\nthe ‘-j’ option, there is no limit on the number of job slots. The default number of job\\nslots is one, which means serial execution (one thing at a time).\\n\\nHandling recursive make invocations raises issues for parallel execution. For more infor-\\n\\nmation on this, see Section 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 59.\\n\\nIf a recipe fails (is killed by a signal or exits with a nonzero status), and errors are\\nnot ignored for that recipe (see Section 5.5 [Errors in Recipes], page 54), the remaining\\nrecipe lines to remake the same target will not be run.\\nIf a recipe fails and the ‘-k’ or\\n‘--keep-going’ option was not given (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114),\\nmake aborts execution. If make terminates for any reason (including a signal) with child\\nprocesses running, it waits for them to finish before actually exiting.\\n\\nWhen the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs than when\\nit is lightly loaded. You can use the ‘-l’ option to tell make to limit the number of jobs to\\nrun at once, based on the load average. The ‘-l’ or ‘--max-load’ option is followed by a\\nfloating-point number. For example,\\n\\n-l 2.5\\n\\nwill not let make start more than one job if the load average is above 2.5. The ‘-l’ option\\nwith no following number removes the load limit, if one was given with a previous ‘-l’\\noption.\\n\\nMore precisely, when make goes to start up a job, and it already has at least one job\\nrunning, it checks the current load average; if it is not lower than the limit given with ‘-l’,\\nmake waits until the load average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.\\n\\nBy default, there is no load limit.\\n\\n5.4.1 Disabling Parallel Execution\\nIf a makefile completely and accurately defines the dependency relationships between all of\\nits targets, then make will correctly build the goals regardless of whether parallel execution\\nis enabled or not. This is the ideal way to write makefiles.\\n\\nHowever, sometimes some or all of the targets in a makefile cannot be executed in parallel\\nand it’s not feasible to add the prerequisites needed to inform make. In that case the makefile\\ncan use various methods to disable parallel execution.\\n\\nIf the .NOTPARALLEL special target with no prerequisites is specified anywhere then the\\nentire instance of make will be run serially, regardless of the parallel setting. For example:\\n\\n\\x0c52\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nall: one two three\\none two three: ; @sleep 1; echo $@\\n\\n.NOTPARALLEL:\\n\\nRegardless of how make is invoked, the targets one, two, and three will be run serially.\\n\\nIf the .NOTPARALLEL special target has prerequisites, then each of those prerequisites will\\nbe considered a target and all prerequisites of these targets will be run serially. Note that\\nonly when building this target will the prerequisites be run serially:\\nif some other target\\nlists the same prerequisites and is not in .NOTPARALLEL then these prerequisites may be run\\nin parallel. For example:\\n\\nall: base notparallel\\n\\nbase: one two three\\nnotparallel: one two three\\n\\none two three: ; @sleep 1; echo $@\\n\\n.NOTPARALLEL: notparallel\\n\\nHere ‘make -j base’ will run the targets one, two, and three in parallel, while ‘make\\n-j notparallel’ will run them serially. If you run ‘make -j all’ then they will be run in\\nparallel since base lists them as prerequisites and is not serialized.\\n\\nThe .NOTPARALLEL target should not have commands.\\n\\nFinally you can control the serialization of specific prerequisites in a fine-grained way\\nusing the .WAIT special target. When this target appears in a prerequisite list and parallel\\nexecution is enabled, make will not build any of the prerequisites to the right of .WAIT until\\nall prerequisites to the left of .WAIT have completed. For example:\\n\\nall: one two .WAIT three\\none two three: ; @sleep 1; echo $@\\n\\nIf parallel execution is enabled, make will try to build one and two in parallel but will\\n\\nnot try to build three until both are complete.\\n\\nAs with targets provided to .NOTPARALLEL, .WAIT takes effect only when building the\\ntarget in whose prerequisite list it appears. If the same prerequisites are present in other\\ntargets, without .WAIT, then they may still be run in parallel. Because of this, neither\\n.NOTPARALLEL with targets nor .WAIT are as reliable for controlling parallel execution as\\ndefining a prerequisite relationship. However they are easy to use and may be sufficient in\\nless complex situations.\\n\\nThe .WAIT prerequisite will not be present in any of the automatic variables for the rule.\\n\\nYou can create an actual target .WAIT in your makefile for portability but this is not\\nrequired to use this feature. If a .WAIT target is created it should not have prerequisites or\\ncommands.\\n\\nThe .WAIT feature is also implemented in other versions of make and it’s specified in the\\n\\nPOSIX standard for make.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n53\\n\\n5.4.2 Output During Parallel Execution\\nWhen running several recipes in parallel the output from each recipe appears as soon as\\nit is generated, with the result that messages from different recipes may be interspersed,\\nsometimes even appearing on the same line. This can make reading the output very difficult.\\nTo avoid this you can use the ‘--output-sync’ (‘-O’) option. This option instructs make\\nto save the output from the commands it invokes and print it all once the commands are\\ncompleted. Additionally, if there are multiple recursive make invocations running in parallel,\\nthey will communicate so that only one of them is generating output at a time.\\n\\nIf working directory printing is enabled (see Section 5.7.4 [The ‘--print-directory’\\nOption], page 61), the enter/leave messages are printed around each output grouping. If\\nyou prefer not to see these messages add the ‘--no-print-directory’ option to MAKEFLAGS.\\nThere are four levels of granularity when synchronizing output, specified by giving an\\n\\nargument to the option (e.g., ‘-Oline’ or ‘--output-sync=recurse’).\\n\\nnone\\n\\nline\\n\\ntarget\\n\\nThis is the default: all output is sent directly as it is generated and no synchro-\\nnization is performed.\\n\\nOutput from each individual line of the recipe is grouped and printed as soon\\nas that line is complete.\\nIf a recipe consists of multiple lines, they may be\\ninterspersed with lines from other recipes.\\n\\nOutput from the entire recipe for each target is grouped and printed once the\\ntarget is complete. This is the default if the --output-sync or -O option is\\ngiven with no argument.\\n\\nrecurse\\n\\nOutput from each recursive invocation of make is grouped and printed once the\\nrecursive invocation is complete.\\n\\nRegardless of the mode chosen, the total build time will be the same. The only difference\\n\\nis in how the output appears.\\n\\nThe ‘target’ and ‘recurse’ modes both collect the output of the entire recipe of a target\\nand display it uninterrupted when the recipe completes. The difference between them is in\\nhow recipes that contain recursive invocations of make are treated (see Section 5.7 [Recursive\\nUse of make], page 56). For all recipes which have no recursive lines, the ‘target’ and\\n‘recurse’ modes behave identically.\\n\\nIf the ‘recurse’ mode is chosen, recipes that contain recursive make invocations are\\ntreated the same as other targets: the output from the recipe, including the output from\\nthe recursive make, is saved and printed after the entire recipe is complete. This ensures\\noutput from all the targets built by a given recursive make instance are grouped together,\\nwhich may make the output easier to understand. However it also leads to long periods of\\ntime during the build where no output is seen, followed by large bursts of output. If you\\nare not watching the build as it proceeds, but instead viewing a log of the build after the\\nfact, this may be the best option for you.\\n\\nIf you are watching the output, the long gaps of quiet during the build can be frustrat-\\ning. The ‘target’ output synchronization mode detects when make is going to be invoked\\nrecursively, using the standard methods, and it will not synchronize the output of those\\nlines. The recursive make will perform the synchronization for its targets and the output\\nfrom each will be displayed immediately when it completes. Be aware that output from\\n\\n\\x0c54\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nrecursive lines of the recipe are not synchronized (for example if the recursive line prints a\\nmessage before running make, that message will not be synchronized).\\n\\nThe ‘line’ mode can be useful for front-ends that are watching the output of make to\\n\\ntrack when recipes are started and completed.\\n\\nSome programs invoked by make may behave differently if they determine they’re writing\\noutput to a terminal versus a file (often described as “interactive” vs. “non-interactive”\\nmodes). For example, many programs that can display colorized output will not do so\\nif they determine they are not writing to a terminal. If your makefile invokes a program\\nlike this then using the output synchronization options will cause the program to believe\\nit’s running in “non-interactive” mode even though the output will ultimately go to the\\nterminal.\\n\\n5.4.3 Input During Parallel Execution\\nTwo processes cannot both take input from the same device at the same time. To make\\nsure that only one recipe tries to take input from the terminal at once, make will invalidate\\nthe standard input streams of all but one running recipe. If another recipe attempts to read\\nfrom standard input it will usually incur a fatal error (a ‘Broken pipe’ signal).\\n\\nIt is unpredictable which recipe will have a valid standard input stream (which will come\\nfrom the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard input of make). The first recipe\\nrun will always get it first, and the first recipe started after that one finishes will get it next,\\nand so on.\\n\\nWe will change how this aspect of make works if we find a better alternative. In the\\nmean time, you should not rely on any recipe using standard input at all if you are using\\nthe parallel execution feature; but if you are not using this feature, then standard input\\nworks normally in all recipes.\\n\\n5.5 Errors in Recipes\\n\\nIf the shell completed\\nAfter each shell invocation returns, make looks at its exit status.\\nsuccessfully (the exit status is zero), the next line in the recipe is executed in a new shell;\\nafter the last line is finished, the rule is finished.\\n\\nIf there is an error (the exit status is nonzero), make gives up on the current rule, and\\n\\nperhaps on all rules.\\n\\nSometimes the failure of a certain recipe line does not indicate a problem. For example,\\nyou may use the mkdir command to ensure that a directory exists. If the directory already\\nexists, mkdir will report an error, but you probably want make to continue regardless.\\n\\nTo ignore errors in a recipe line, write a ‘-’ at the beginning of the line’s text (after the\\n\\ninitial tab). The ‘-’ is discarded before the line is passed to the shell for execution.\\n\\nFor example,\\nclean:\\n\\n-rm -f *.o\\n\\nThis causes make to continue even if rm is unable to remove a file.\\n\\nWhen you run make with the ‘-i’ or ‘--ignore-errors’ flag, errors are ignored in all\\nrecipes of all rules. A rule in the makefile for the special target .IGNORE has the same effect,\\nif there are no prerequisites. This is less flexible but sometimes useful.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n55\\n\\nWhen errors are to be ignored, because of either a ‘-’ or the ‘-i’ flag, make treats an\\nerror return just like success, except that it prints out a message that tells you the status\\ncode the shell exited with, and says that the error has been ignored.\\n\\nWhen an error happens that make has not been told to ignore, it implies that the\\ncurrent target cannot be correctly remade, and neither can any other that depends on it\\neither directly or indirectly. No further recipes will be executed for these targets, since their\\npreconditions have not been achieved.\\n\\nNormally make gives up immediately in this circumstance, returning a nonzero status.\\nHowever, if the ‘-k’ or ‘--keep-going’ flag is specified, make continues to consider the\\nother prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up\\nand returns nonzero status. For example, after an error in compiling one object file, ‘make\\n-k’ will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows that linking them\\nwill be impossible. See Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114.\\n\\nThe usual behavior assumes that your purpose is to get the specified targets up to date;\\nonce make learns that this is impossible, it might as well report the failure immediately.\\nThe ‘-k’ option says that the real purpose is to test as many of the changes made in the\\nprogram as possible, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can correct\\nthem all before the next attempt to compile. This is why Emacs’ compile command passes\\nthe ‘-k’ flag by default.\\n\\nUsually when a recipe line fails, if it has changed the target file at all, the file is corrupted\\nand cannot be used—or at least it is not completely updated. Yet the file’s time stamp says\\nthat it is now up to date, so the next time make runs, it will not try to update that file. The\\nsituation is just the same as when the shell is killed by a signal; see Section 5.6 [Interrupts],\\npage 55. So generally the right thing to do is to delete the target file if the recipe fails after\\nbeginning to change the file. make will do this if .DELETE_ON_ERROR appears as a target.\\nThis is almost always what you want make to do, but it is not historical practice; so for\\ncompatibility, you must explicitly request it.\\n\\n5.6 Interrupting or Killing make\\nIf make gets a fatal signal while a shell is executing, it may delete the target file that the\\nrecipe was supposed to update. This is done if the target file’s last-modification time has\\nchanged since make first checked it.\\n\\nThe purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from scratch when\\nmake is next run. Why is this? Suppose you type Ctrl-c while a compiler is running, and\\nit has begun to write an object file foo.o. The Ctrl-c kills the compiler, resulting in an\\nincomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source file foo.c. But make\\nalso receives the Ctrl-c signal and deletes this incomplete file. If make did not do this, the\\nnext invocation of make would think that foo.o did not require updating—resulting in a\\nstrange error message from the linker when it tries to link an object file half of which is\\nmissing.\\n\\nYou can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the special target\\n.PRECIOUS depend on it. Before remaking a target, make checks to see whether it appears\\non the prerequisites of .PRECIOUS, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted\\nif a signal happens. Some reasons why you might do this are that the target is updated\\n\\n\\x0c56\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nin some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a modification-time (its contents do not\\nmatter), or must exist at all times to prevent other sorts of trouble.\\n\\nAlthough make does its best to clean up there are certain situations in which cleanup\\nis impossible. For example, make may be killed by an uncatchable signal. Or, one of the\\nprograms make invokes may be killed or crash, leaving behind an up-to-date but corrupt\\ntarget file: make will not realize that this failure requires the target to be cleaned. Or make\\nitself may encounter a bug and crash.\\n\\nFor these reasons it’s best to write defensive recipes, which won’t leave behind corrupted\\ntargets even if they fail. Most commonly these recipes create temporary files rather than\\nupdating the target directly, then rename the temporary file to the final target name. Some\\ncompilers already behave this way, so that you don’t need to write a defensive recipe.\\n\\n5.7 Recursive Use of make\\nRecursive use of make means using make as a command in a makefile. This technique\\nis useful when you want separate makefiles for various subsystems that compose a larger\\nsystem. For example, suppose you have a sub-directory subdir which has its own makefile,\\nand you would like the containing directory’s makefile to run make on the sub-directory.\\nYou can do it by writing this:\\n\\nsubsystem:\\n\\ncd subdir && $(MAKE)\\n\\nor, equivalently, this (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114):\\n\\nsubsystem:\\n\\n$(MAKE) -C subdir\\n\\nYou can write recursive make commands just by copying this example, but there are\\nmany things to know about how they work and why, and about how the sub-make relates to\\nthe top-level make. You may also find it useful to declare targets that invoke recursive make\\ncommands as ‘.PHONY’ (for more discussion on when this is useful, see Section 4.5 [Phony\\nTargets], page 31).\\n\\nFor your convenience, when GNU make starts (after it has processed any -C options)\\nit sets the variable CURDIR to the pathname of the current working directory. This value\\nis never touched by make again:\\nin particular note that if you include files from other\\ndirectories the value of CURDIR does not change. The value has the same precedence it\\nwould have if it were set in the makefile (by default, an environment variable CURDIR will\\nnot override this value). Note that setting this variable has no impact on the operation of\\nmake (it does not cause make to change its working directory, for example).\\n\\n5.7.1 How the MAKE Variable Works\\nRecursive make commands should always use the variable MAKE, not the explicit command\\nname ‘make’, as shown here:\\n\\nsubsystem:\\n\\ncd subdir && $(MAKE)\\n\\nThe value of this variable is the file name with which make was invoked. If this file name\\nwas /bin/make, then the recipe executed is ‘cd subdir && /bin/make’. If you use a special\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n57\\n\\nversion of make to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be executed for\\nrecursive invocations.\\n\\nAs a special feature, using the variable MAKE in the recipe of a rule alters the effects of\\nthe ‘-t’ (‘--touch’), ‘-n’ (‘--just-print’), or ‘-q’ (‘--question’) option. Using the MAKE\\nvariable has the same effect as using a ‘+’ character at the beginning of the recipe line.\\nSee Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing the Recipes], page 111. This special feature is only\\nit does not apply if the MAKE\\nenabled if the MAKE variable appears directly in the recipe:\\nvariable is referenced through expansion of another variable. In the latter case you must\\nuse the ‘+’ token to get these special effects.\\n\\nConsider the command ‘make -t’ in the above example. (The ‘-t’ option marks targets\\nas up to date without actually running any recipes; see Section 9.3 [Instead of Execution],\\npage 111.) Following the usual definition of ‘-t’, a ‘make -t’ command in the example\\nwould create a file named subsystem and do nothing else. What you really want it to do is\\nrun ‘cd subdir && make -t’; but that would require executing the recipe, and ‘-t’ says not\\nto execute recipes.\\n\\nThe special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a recipe line of a rule\\ncontains the variable MAKE, the flags ‘-t’, ‘-n’ and ‘-q’ do not apply to that line. Recipe\\nlines containing MAKE are executed normally despite the presence of a flag that causes most\\nrecipes not to be run. The usual MAKEFLAGS mechanism passes the flags to the sub-make\\n(see Section 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 59), so your request to\\ntouch the files, or print the recipes, is propagated to the subsystem.\\n\\n5.7.2 Communicating Variables to a Sub-make\\nVariable values of the top-level make can be passed to the sub-make through the environment\\nby explicit request. These variables are defined in the sub-make as defaults, but they do\\nnot override variables defined in the makefile used by the sub-make unless you use the ‘-e’\\nswitch (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114).\\n\\nTo pass down, or export, a variable, make adds the variable and its value to the envi-\\nronment for running each line of the recipe. The sub-make, in turn, uses the environment\\nto initialize its table of variable values. See Section 6.10 [Variables from the Environment],\\npage 77.\\n\\nExcept by explicit request, make exports a variable only if it is either defined in the\\nenvironment initially, or if set on the command line and its name consists only of letters,\\nnumbers, and underscores.\\n\\nThe value of the make variable SHELL is not exported. Instead, the value of the SHELL\\nvariable from the invoking environment is passed to the sub-make. You can force make to\\nexport its value for SHELL by using the export directive, described below. See Section 5.3.2\\n[Choosing the Shell], page 49.\\n\\nThe special variable MAKEFLAGS is always exported (unless you unexport it). MAKEFILES\\n\\nis exported if you set it to anything.\\n\\nmake automatically passes down variable values that were defined on the command line,\\n\\nby putting them in the MAKEFLAGS variable. See the next section.\\n\\nVariables are not normally passed down if they were created by default by make (see\\nSection 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125). The sub-make will define these\\nfor itself.\\n\\n\\x0c58\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nIf you want to export specific variables to a sub-make, use the export directive, like this:\\n\\nexport variable ...\\n\\nIf you want to prevent a variable from being exported, use the unexport directive, like this:\\n\\nunexport variable ...\\n\\nIn both of these forms, the arguments to export and unexport are expanded, and so could\\nbe variables or functions which expand to a (list of) variable names to be (un)exported.\\n\\nAs a convenience, you can define a variable and export it at the same time by doing:\\n\\nexport variable = value\\n\\nhas the same result as:\\n\\nvariable = value\\nexport variable\\n\\nand\\n\\nexport variable := value\\n\\nhas the same result as:\\n\\nvariable := value\\nexport variable\\n\\nLikewise,\\n\\nexport variable += value\\n\\nis just like:\\n\\nvariable += value\\nexport variable\\n\\nSee Section 6.6 [Appending More Text to Variables], page 74.\\n\\nYou may notice that the export and unexport directives work in make in the same way\\n\\nthey work in the shell, sh.\\n\\nIf you want all variables to be exported by default, you can use export by itself:\\n\\nexport\\n\\nThis tells make that variables which are not explicitly mentioned in an export or unexport\\ndirective should be exported. Any variable given in an unexport directive will still not be\\nexported.\\n\\nThe behavior elicited by an export directive by itself was the default in older versions\\nof GNU make. If your makefiles depend on this behavior and you want to be compatible\\nwith old versions of make, you can add the special target .EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES to your\\nmakefile instead of using the export directive. This will be ignored by old makes, while the\\nexport directive will cause a syntax error.\\n\\nWhen using export by itself or .EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES to export variables by default,\\nonly variables whose names consist solely of alphanumerics and underscores will be exported.\\nTo export other variables you must specifically mention them in an export directive.\\n\\nAdding a variable’s value to the environment requires it to be expanded. If expanding\\na variable has side-effects (such as the info or eval or similar functions) then these side-\\neffects will be seen every time a command is invoked. You can avoid this by ensuring that\\nsuch variables have names which are not exportable by default. However, a better solution is\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n59\\n\\nto not use this “export by default” facility at all, and instead explicitly export the relevant\\nvariables by name.\\n\\nYou can use unexport by itself to tell make not to export variables by default. Since\\nthis is the default behavior, you would only need to do this if export had been used by\\nitself earlier (in an included makefile, perhaps). You cannot use export and unexport by\\nthemselves to have variables exported for some recipes and not for others. The last export\\nor unexport directive that appears by itself determines the behavior for the entire run of\\nmake.\\n\\nAs a special feature, the variable MAKELEVEL is changed when it is passed down from\\nlevel to level. This variable’s value is a string which is the depth of the level as a decimal\\nnumber. The value is ‘0’ for the top-level make; ‘1’ for a sub-make, ‘2’ for a sub-sub-make,\\nand so on. The incrementation happens when make sets up the environment for a recipe.\\n\\nThe main use of MAKELEVEL is to test it in a conditional directive (see Chapter 7 [Con-\\nditional Parts of Makefiles], page 85); this way you can write a makefile that behaves one\\nway if run recursively and another way if run directly by you.\\n\\nYou can use the variable MAKEFILES to cause all sub-make commands to use additional\\nmakefiles. The value of MAKEFILES is a whitespace-separated list of file names. This variable,\\nif defined in the outer-level makefile, is passed down through the environment; then it serves\\nas a list of extra makefiles for the sub-make to read before the usual or specified ones. See\\nSection 3.4 [The Variable MAKEFILES], page 14.\\n\\n5.7.3 Communicating Options to a Sub-make\\nFlags such as ‘-s’ and ‘-k’ are passed automatically to the sub-make through the variable\\nMAKEFLAGS. This variable is set up automatically by make to contain the flag letters that\\nmake received. Thus, if you do ‘make -ks’ then MAKEFLAGS gets the value ‘ks’.\\n\\nAs a consequence, every sub-make gets a value for MAKEFLAGS in its environment. In\\nresponse, it takes the flags from that value and processes them as if they had been given\\nas arguments. See Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114. This means that, unlike\\nother environment variables, MAKEFLAGS specified in the environment take precedence over\\nMAKEFLAGS specified in the makefile.\\n\\nThe value of MAKEFLAGS is a possibly empty group of characters representing single-letter\\noptions that take no argument, followed by a space and any options that take arguments\\nor which have long option names. If an option has both single-letter and long options, the\\nsingle-letter option is always preferred. If there are no single-letter options on the command\\nline, then the value of MAKEFLAGS starts with a space.\\n\\nLikewise variables defined on the command line are passed to the sub-make through\\nMAKEFLAGS. Words in the value of MAKEFLAGS that contain ‘=’, make treats as variable\\ndefinitions just as if they appeared on the command line. See Section 9.5 [Overriding\\nVariables], page 113.\\n\\nThe options ‘-C’, ‘-f’, ‘-o’, and ‘-W’ are not put into MAKEFLAGS; these options are not\\n\\npassed down.\\n\\nThe ‘-j’ option is a special case (see Section 5.4 [Parallel Execution], page 51). If you set\\nit to some numeric value ‘N’ and your operating system supports it (most any UNIX system\\nwill; others typically won’t), the parent make and all the sub-makes will communicate to\\nensure that there are only ‘N’ jobs running at the same time between them all. Note that\\n\\n\\x0c60\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nany job that is marked recursive (see Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes], page 111)\\ndoesn’t count against the total jobs (otherwise we could get ‘N’ sub-makes running and have\\nno slots left over for any real work!)\\n\\nIf your operating system doesn’t support the above communication, then no ‘-j’ is added\\nto MAKEFLAGS, so that sub-makes run in non-parallel mode. If the ‘-j’ option were passed\\ndown to sub-makes you would get many more jobs running in parallel than you asked for.\\nIf you give ‘-j’ with no numeric argument, meaning to run as many jobs as possible in\\nparallel, this is passed down, since multiple infinities are no more than one.\\n\\nIf you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the value of MAKEFLAGS,\\n\\nfor example like this:\\n\\nsubsystem:\\n\\ncd subdir && $(MAKE) MAKEFLAGS=\\n\\nThe command line variable definitions really appear in the variable MAKEOVERRIDES,\\nand MAKEFLAGS contains a reference to this variable.\\nIf you do want to pass flags down\\nnormally, but don’t want to pass down the command line variable definitions, you can reset\\nMAKEOVERRIDES to empty, like this:\\n\\nMAKEOVERRIDES =\\n\\nThis is not usually useful to do. However, some systems have a small fixed limit on the\\nsize of the environment, and putting so much information into the value of MAKEFLAGS can\\nexceed it. If you see the error message ‘Arg list too long’, this may be the problem. (For\\nstrict compliance with POSIX.2, changing MAKEOVERRIDES does not affect MAKEFLAGS if the\\nspecial target ‘.POSIX’ appears in the makefile. You probably do not care about this.)\\n\\nA similar variable MFLAGS exists also, for historical compatibility.\\n\\nIt has the same\\nvalue as MAKEFLAGS except that it does not contain the command line variable defini-\\ntions, and it always begins with a hyphen unless it is empty (MAKEFLAGS begins with\\na hyphen only when it begins with an option that has no single-letter version, such as\\n‘--warn-undefined-variables’). MFLAGS was traditionally used explicitly in the recursive\\nmake command, like this:\\n\\nsubsystem:\\n\\ncd subdir && $(MAKE) $(MFLAGS)\\n\\nbut now MAKEFLAGS makes this usage redundant. If you want your makefiles to be compat-\\nible with old make programs, use this technique; it will work fine with more modern make\\nversions too.\\n\\nThe MAKEFLAGS variable can also be useful if you want to have certain options, such as\\n‘-k’ (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114), set each time you run make. You\\nsimply put a value for MAKEFLAGS in your environment. You can also set MAKEFLAGS in a\\nmakefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for that makefile. (Note\\nthat you cannot use MFLAGS this way. That variable is set only for compatibility; make does\\nnot interpret a value you set for it in any way.)\\n\\nWhen make interprets the value of MAKEFLAGS (either from the environment or from a\\nmakefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value does not already begin with one. Then\\nit chops the value into words separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were\\noptions given on the command line (except that ‘-C’, ‘-f’, ‘-h’, ‘-o’, ‘-W’, and their long-\\nnamed versions are ignored; and there is no error for an invalid option).\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n61\\n\\nIf you do put MAKEFLAGS in your environment, you should be sure not to include any\\noptions that will drastically affect the actions of make and undermine the purpose of make-\\nfiles and of make itself. For instance, the ‘-t’, ‘-n’, and ‘-q’ options, if put in one of these\\nvariables, could have disastrous consequences and would certainly have at least surprising\\nand probably annoying effects.\\n\\nIf you’d like to run other implementations of make in addition to GNU make, and hence\\ndo not want to add GNU make-specific flags to the MAKEFLAGS variable, you can add them\\nto the GNUMAKEFLAGS variable instead. This variable is parsed just before MAKEFLAGS, in\\nthe same way as MAKEFLAGS. When make constructs MAKEFLAGS to pass to a recursive make\\nit will include all flags, even those taken from GNUMAKEFLAGS. As a result, after parsing\\nGNUMAKEFLAGS GNU make sets this variable to the empty string to avoid duplicating flags\\nduring recursion.\\n\\nIt’s best to use GNUMAKEFLAGS only with flags which won’t materially change the be-\\nIf your makefiles require GNU Make anyway then simply use\\nhavior of your makefiles.\\nMAKEFLAGS. Flags such as ‘--no-print-directory’ or ‘--output-sync’ may be appropri-\\nate for GNUMAKEFLAGS.\\n\\n5.7.4 The ‘--print-directory’ Option\\nIf you use several levels of recursive make invocations, the ‘-w’ or ‘--print-directory’\\noption can make the output a lot easier to understand by showing each directory as make\\nstarts processing it and as make finishes processing it. For example, if ‘make -w’ is run in\\nthe directory /u/gnu/make, make will print a line of the form:\\n\\nmake: Entering directory ‘/u/gnu/make’.\\n\\nbefore doing anything else, and a line of the form:\\n\\nmake: Leaving directory ‘/u/gnu/make’.\\n\\nwhen processing is completed.\\n\\n‘-w’\\nNormally, you do not need to specify this option because ‘make’ does it for you:\\nis turned on automatically when you use the ‘-C’ option, and in sub-makes. make will\\nnot automatically turn on ‘-w’ if you also use ‘-s’, which says to be silent, or if you use\\n‘--no-print-directory’ to explicitly disable it.\\n\\n5.8 Defining Canned Recipes\\n\\nWhen the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets, you can define\\nit as a canned sequence with the define directive, and refer to the canned sequence from\\nthe recipes for those targets. The canned sequence is actually a variable, so the name must\\nnot conflict with other variable names.\\n\\nHere is an example of defining a canned recipe:\\n\\ndefine run-yacc =\\nyacc $(firstword $^)\\nmv y.tab.c $@\\nendef\\n\\nHere run-yacc is the name of the variable being defined; endef marks the end of the\\ndefinition; the lines in between are the commands. The define directive does not expand\\nvariable references and function calls in the canned sequence; the ‘$’ characters, parentheses,\\n\\n\\x0c62\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nvariable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the variable you are defining. See\\nSection 6.8 [Defining Multi-Line Variables], page 76, for a complete explanation of define.\\n\\nThe first command in this example runs Yacc on the first prerequisite of whichever rule\\nuses the canned sequence. The output file from Yacc is always named y.tab.c. The second\\ncommand moves the output to the rule’s target file name.\\n\\nTo use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the recipe of a rule. You\\ncan substitute it like any other variable (see Section 6.1 [Basics of Variable References],\\npage 65). Because variables defined by define are recursively expanded variables, all the\\nvariable references you wrote inside the define are expanded now. For example:\\n\\nfoo.c : foo.y\\n\\n$(run-yacc)\\n\\n‘foo.y’ will be substituted for the variable ‘$^’ when it occurs in run-yacc’s value, and\\n‘foo.c’ for ‘$@’.\\n\\nThis is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in practice because\\nmake has an implicit rule to figure out these commands based on the file names involved\\n(see Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules], page 121).\\n\\nIn recipe execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as if the line appeared\\non its own in the rule, preceded by a tab. In particular, make invokes a separate sub-shell for\\neach line. You can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines (‘@’, ‘-’, and\\n‘+’) on each line of a canned sequence. See Chapter 5 [Writing Recipes in Rules], page 45.\\nFor example, using this canned sequence:\\n\\ndefine frobnicate =\\n@echo \"frobnicating target $@\"\\nfrob-step-1 $< -o $@-step-1\\nfrob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@\\nendef\\n\\nmake will not echo the first line, the echo command. But it will echo the following two\\nrecipe lines.\\n\\nOn the other hand, prefix characters on the recipe line that refers to a canned sequence\\n\\napply to every line in the sequence. So the rule:\\n\\nfrob.out: frob.in\\n\\n@$(frobnicate)\\n\\ndoes not echo any recipe lines.\\nexplanation of ‘@’.)\\n\\n(See Section 5.2 [Recipe Echoing], page 47, for a full\\n\\n5.9 Using Empty Recipes\\n\\nIt is sometimes useful to define recipes which do nothing. This is done simply by giving a\\nrecipe that consists of nothing but whitespace. For example:\\n\\ntarget: ;\\n\\ndefines an empty recipe for target. You could also use a line beginning with a recipe prefix\\ncharacter to define an empty recipe, but this would be confusing because such a line looks\\nempty.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 5: Writing Recipes in Rules\\n\\n63\\n\\nYou may be wondering why you would want to define a recipe that does nothing. One\\nreason this is useful is to prevent a target from getting implicit recipes (from implicit rules or\\nthe .DEFAULT special target; see Chapter 10 [Implicit Rules], page 121, and see Section 10.6\\n[Defining Last-Resort Default Rules], page 135).\\n\\nEmpty recipes can also be used to avoid errors for targets that will be created as a\\nside-effect of another recipe: if the target does not exist the empty recipe ensures that make\\nwon’t complain that it doesn’t know how to build the target, and make will assume the\\ntarget is out of date.\\n\\nYou may be inclined to define empty recipes for targets that are not actual files, but\\nonly exist so that their prerequisites can be remade. However, this is not the best way to\\ndo that, because the prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually\\ndoes exist. See Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31, for a better way to do this.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c65\\n\\n6 How to Use Variables\\n\\nA variable is a name defined in a makefile to represent a string of text, called the variable’s\\nvalue. These values are substituted by explicit request into targets, prerequisites, recipes,\\nand other parts of the makefile. (In some other versions of make, variables are called macros.)\\n\\nVariables and functions in all parts of a makefile are expanded when read, except for\\nin recipes, the right-hand sides of variable definitions using ‘=’, and the bodies of variable\\ndefinitions using the define directive. The value a variable expands to is that of its most\\nrecent definition at the time of expansion. In other words, variables are dynamically scoped.\\n\\nVariables can represent lists of file names, options to pass to compilers, programs to run,\\ndirectories to look in for source files, directories to write output in, or anything else you can\\nimagine.\\n\\nA variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing ‘:’, ‘#’, ‘=’, or white-\\nspace. However, variable names containing characters other than letters, numbers, and\\nunderscores should be considered carefully, as in some shells they cannot be passed through\\nthe environment to a sub-make (see Section 5.7.2 [Communicating Variables to a Sub-make],\\npage 57). Variable names beginning with ‘.’ and an uppercase letter may be given special\\nmeaning in future versions of make.\\n\\nVariable names are case-sensitive. The names ‘foo’, ‘FOO’, and ‘Foo’ all refer to different\\n\\nvariables.\\n\\nIt is traditional to use upper case letters in variable names, but we recommend using lower\\ncase letters for variable names that serve internal purposes in the makefile, and reserving\\nupper case for parameters that control implicit rules or for parameters that the user should\\noverride with command options (see Section 9.5 [Overriding Variables], page 113).\\n\\nA few variables have names that are a single punctuation character or just a few char-\\nacters. These are the automatic variables, and they have particular specialized uses. See\\nSection 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130.\\n\\n6.1 Basics of Variable References\\n\\nTo substitute a variable’s value, write a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable in\\nparentheses or braces: either ‘$(foo)’ or ‘${foo}’ is a valid reference to the variable foo.\\nThis special significance of ‘$’ is why you must write ‘$$’ to have the effect of a single dollar\\nsign in a file name or recipe.\\n\\nVariable references can be used in any context: targets, prerequisites, recipes, most\\ndirectives, and new variable values. Here is an example of a common case, where a variable\\nholds the names of all the object files in a program:\\n\\nobjects = program.o foo.o utils.o\\nprogram : $(objects)\\n\\ncc -o program $(objects)\\n\\n$(objects) : defs.h\\n\\nVariable references work by strict textual substitution. Thus, the rule\\n\\n\\x0c66\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nfoo = c\\nprog.o : prog.$(foo)\\n\\n$(foo)$(foo) -$(foo) prog.$(foo)\\n\\ncould be used to compile a C program prog.c. Since spaces before the variable value are\\nignored in variable assignments, the value of foo is precisely ‘c’. (Don’t actually write your\\nmakefiles this way!)\\n\\nA dollar sign followed by a character other than a dollar sign, open-parenthesis or open-\\nbrace treats that single character as the variable name. Thus, you could reference the\\nvariable x with ‘$x’. However, this practice can lead to confusion (e.g., ‘$foo’ refers to the\\nvariable f followed by the string oo) so we recommend using parentheses or braces around\\nall variables, even single-letter variables, unless omitting them gives significant readability\\nimprovements. One place where readability is often improved is automatic variables (see\\nSection 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\n6.2 The Two Flavors of Variables\\n\\nThere are different ways that a variable in GNU make can get a value; we call them the\\nflavors of variables. The flavors are distinguished in how they handle the values they are\\nassigned in the makefile, and in how those values are managed when the variable is later\\nused and expanded.\\n\\n6.2.1 Recursively Expanded Variable Assignment\\nThe first flavor of variable is a recursively expanded variable. Variables of this sort are\\ndefined by lines using ‘=’ (see Section 6.5 [Setting Variables], page 72) or by the define\\ndirective (see Section 6.8 [Defining Multi-Line Variables], page 76). The value you specify is\\ninstalled verbatim; if it contains references to other variables, these references are expanded\\nwhenever this variable is substituted (in the course of expanding some other string). When\\nthis happens, it is called recursive expansion.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nfoo = $(bar)\\nbar = $(ugh)\\nugh = Huh?\\n\\nall:;echo $(foo)\\n\\nwill echo ‘Huh?’:\\nexpands to ‘Huh?’.\\n\\n‘$(foo)’ expands to ‘$(bar)’ which expands to ‘$(ugh)’ which finally\\n\\nThis flavor of variable is the only sort supported by most other versions of make. It has\\n\\nits advantages and its disadvantages. An advantage (most would say) is that:\\n\\nCFLAGS = $(include_dirs) -O\\ninclude_dirs = -Ifoo -Ibar\\n\\nwill do what was intended: when ‘CFLAGS’ is expanded in a recipe, it will expand to ‘-Ifoo\\n-Ibar -O’. A major disadvantage is that you cannot append something on the end of a\\nvariable, as in\\n\\nCFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -O\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n67\\n\\nbecause it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion. (Actually make detects the\\ninfinite loop and reports an error.)\\n\\nAnother disadvantage is that any functions (see Chapter 8 [Functions for Transforming\\nText], page 91) referenced in the definition will be executed every time the variable is\\nexpanded. This makes make run slower; worse, it causes the wildcard and shell functions\\nto give unpredictable results because you cannot easily control when they are called, or\\neven how many times.\\n\\n6.2.2 Simply Expanded Variable Assignment\\nTo avoid the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded variables, there is another\\nflavor: simply expanded variables.\\n\\nSimply expanded variables are defined by lines using ‘:=’ or ‘::=’ (see Section 6.5 [Setting\\nVariables], page 72). Both forms are equivalent in GNU make; however only the ‘::=’ form\\nis described by the POSIX standard (support for ‘::=’ is added to the POSIX standard for\\nPOSIX Issue 8).\\n\\nThe value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once, expanding any references to\\nother variables and functions, when the variable is defined. Once that expansion is complete\\nthe value of the variable is never expanded again: when the variable is used the value is\\ncopied verbatim as the expansion. If the value contained variable references the result of\\nthe expansion will contain their values as of the time this variable was defined. Therefore,\\n\\nx := foo\\ny := $(x) bar\\nx := later\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\ny := foo bar\\nx := later\\n\\nHere is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of ‘:=’ in conjunction\\nwith the shell function. (See Section 8.14 [The shell Function], page 107.) This example\\nalso shows use of the variable MAKELEVEL, which is changed when it is passed down from\\nlevel to level. (See Section 5.7.2 [Communicating Variables to a Sub-make], page 57, for\\ninformation about MAKELEVEL.)\\nifeq (0,${MAKELEVEL})\\nwhoami\\nhost-type := $(shell arch)\\nMAKE := ${MAKE} host-type=${host-type} whoami=${whoami}\\nendif\\n\\n:= $(shell whoami)\\n\\nAn advantage of this use of ‘:=’ is that a typical ‘descend into a directory’ recipe then looks\\nlike this:\\n\\n${subdirs}:\\n\\n${MAKE} -C $@ all\\n\\nSimply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile programming more pre-\\ndictable because they work like variables in most programming languages. They allow you\\nto redefine a variable using its own value (or its value processed in some way by one of\\nthe expansion functions) and to use the expansion functions much more efficiently (see\\nChapter 8 [Functions for Transforming Text], page 91).\\n\\n\\x0c68\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nYou can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into variable values.\\nLeading whitespace characters are discarded from your input before substitution of variable\\nreferences and function calls; this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value\\nby protecting them with variable references, like this:\\n\\nnullstring :=\\nspace := $(nullstring) # end of the line\\n\\nthe variable space is precisely one space.\\n\\nHere the value of\\nThe comment\\n‘# end of the line’ is included here just for clarity. Since trailing space characters are not\\nstripped from variable values, just a space at the end of the line would have the same\\neffect (but be rather hard to read). If you put whitespace at the end of a variable value,\\nit is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end of the line to make your intent\\nclear. Conversely, if you do not want any whitespace characters at the end of your variable\\nvalue, you must remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after some\\nwhitespace, such as this:\\n\\ndir := /foo/bar\\n\\n# directory to put the frobs in\\n\\nHere the value of the variable dir is ‘/foo/bar ’ (with four trailing spaces), which was\\nprobably not the intention. (Imagine something like ‘$(dir)/file’ with this definition!)\\n\\n6.2.3 Immediately Expanded Variable Assignment\\nAnother form of assignment allows for immediate expansion, but unlike simple assignment\\nthe resulting variable is recursive: it will be re-expanded again on every use. In order to\\navoid unexpected results, after the value is immediately expanded it will automatically be\\nquoted: all instances of $ in the value after expansion will be converted into $$. This type\\nof assignment uses the ‘:::=’ operator. For example,\\n\\nvar = first\\nOUT :::= $(var)\\nvar = second\\n\\nresults in the OUT variable containing the text ‘first’, while here:\\n\\nvar = one$$two\\nOUT :::= $(var)\\nvar = three$$four\\n\\nresults in the OUT variable containing the text ‘one$$two’. The value is expanded when\\nthe variable is assigned, so the result is the expansion of the first value of var, ‘one$two’;\\nthen the value is re-escaped before the assignment is complete giving the final result of\\n‘one$$two’.\\n\\nThe variable OUT is thereafter considered a recursive variable, so it will be re-expanded\\n\\nwhen it is used.\\n\\nThis seems functionally equivalent to the ‘:=’ / ‘::=’ operators, but there are a few\\n\\ndifferences:\\n\\nFirst, after assignment the variable is a normal recursive variable; when you append to\\nit with ‘+=’ the value on the right-hand side is not expanded immediately. If you prefer\\nthe ‘+=’ operator to expand the right-hand side immediately you should use the ‘:=’ / ‘::=’\\nassignment instead.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n69\\n\\nSecond, these variables are slightly less efficient than simply expanded variables since\\nthey do need to be re-expanded when they are used, rather than merely copied. However\\nsince all variable references are escaped this expansion simply un-escapes the value, it won’t\\nexpand any variables or run any functions.\\n\\nHere is another example:\\n\\nvar = one$$two\\nOUT :::= $(var)\\nOUT += $(var)\\nvar = three$$four\\n\\nAfter this, the value of OUT is the text ‘one$$two $(var)’. When this variable is used it\\n\\nwill be expanded and the result will be ‘one$two three$four’.\\n\\nThis style of assignment is equivalent to the traditional BSD make ‘:=’ operator; as you\\ncan see it works slightly differently than the GNU make ‘:=’ operator. The :::= operator\\nis added to the POSIX specification in Issue 8 to provide portability.\\n\\n6.2.4 Conditional Variable Assignment\\nThere is another assignment operator for variables, ‘?=’. This is called a conditional variable\\nassignment operator, because it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined. This\\nstatement:\\n\\nFOO ?= bar\\n\\nis exactly equivalent to this (see Section 8.11 [The origin Function], page 104):\\n\\nifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)\\n\\nFOO = bar\\n\\nendif\\n\\nNote that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so ‘?=’ will not set that\\n\\nvariable.\\n\\n6.3 Advanced Features for Reference to Variables\\n\\nThis section describes some advanced features you can use to reference variables in more\\nflexible ways.\\n\\n6.3.1 Substitution References\\nA substitution reference substitutes the value of a variable with alterations that you specify.\\nIt has the form ‘$(var:a=b)’ (or ‘${var:a=b}’) and its meaning is to take the value of the\\nvariable var, replace every a at the end of a word with b in that value, and substitute the\\nresulting string.\\n\\nWhen we say “at the end of a word”, we mean that a must appear either followed by\\nwhitespace or at the end of the value in order to be replaced; other occurrences of a in the\\nvalue are unaltered. For example:\\n\\nfoo := a.o b.o l.a c.o\\nbar := $(foo:.o=.c)\\n\\nsets ‘bar’ to ‘a.c b.c l.a c.c’. See Section 6.5 [Setting Variables], page 72.\\n\\nA substitution reference is shorthand for the patsubst expansion function (see\\n‘$(var:a=b)’ is\\n\\nSection 8.2 [Functions for String Substitution and Analysis], page 92):\\n\\n\\x0c70\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nequivalent to ‘$(patsubst %a,%b,var)’. We provide substitution references as well as\\npatsubst for compatibility with other implementations of make.\\n\\nAnother type of substitution reference lets you use the full power of the patsubst func-\\ntion. It has the same form ‘$(var:a=b)’ described above, except that now a must contain a\\nsingle ‘%’ character. This case is equivalent to ‘$(patsubst a,b,$(var))’. See Section 8.2\\n[Functions for String Substitution and Analysis], page 92, for a description of the patsubst\\nfunction. For example:\\n\\nfoo := a.o b.o l.a c.o\\nbar := $(foo:%.o=%.c)\\n\\nsets ‘bar’ to ‘a.c b.c l.a c.c’.\\n\\n6.3.2 Computed Variable Names\\nComputed variable names are an advanced concept, very useful in more sophisticated make-\\nfile programming. In simple situations you need not consider them, but they can be ex-\\ntremely useful.\\n\\nVariables may be referenced inside the name of a variable. This is called a computed\\n\\nvariable name or a nested variable reference. For example,\\n\\nx = y\\ny = z\\na := $($(x))\\n\\ndefines a as ‘z’: the ‘$(x)’ inside ‘$($(x))’ expands to ‘y’, so ‘$($(x))’ expands to ‘$(y)’\\nwhich in turn expands to ‘z’. Here the name of the variable to reference is not stated\\nexplicitly; it is computed by expansion of ‘$(x)’. The reference ‘$(x)’ here is nested within\\nthe outer variable reference.\\n\\nThe previous example shows two levels of nesting, but any number of levels is possible.\\n\\nFor example, here are three levels:\\n\\nx = y\\ny = z\\nz = u\\na := $($($(x)))\\n\\nHere the innermost ‘$(x)’ expands to ‘y’, so ‘$($(x))’ expands to ‘$(y)’ which in turn\\nexpands to ‘z’; now we have ‘$(z)’, which becomes ‘u’.\\n\\nReferences to recursively-expanded variables within a variable name are re-expanded in\\n\\nthe usual fashion. For example:\\n\\nx = $(y)\\ny = z\\nz = Hello\\na := $($(x))\\n\\ndefines a as ‘Hello’:\\n‘Hello’.\\n\\n‘$($(x))’ becomes ‘$($(y))’ which becomes ‘$(z)’ which becomes\\n\\nNested variable references can also contain modified references and function invocations\\n(see Chapter 8 [Functions for Transforming Text], page 91), just like any other reference.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n71\\n\\nFor example, using the subst function (see Section 8.2 [Functions for String Substitution\\nand Analysis], page 92):\\n\\nx = variable1\\nvariable2 := Hello\\ny = $(subst 1,2,$(x))\\nz = y\\na := $($($(z)))\\n\\neventually defines a as ‘Hello’. It is doubtful that anyone would ever want to write a nested\\nreference as convoluted as this one, but it works: ‘$($($(z)))’ expands to ‘$($(y))’ which\\nbecomes ‘$($(subst 1,2,$(x)))’. This gets the value ‘variable1’ from x and changes it\\nby substitution to ‘variable2’, so that the entire string becomes ‘$(variable2)’, a simple\\nvariable reference whose value is ‘Hello’.\\n\\nA computed variable name need not consist entirely of a single variable reference. It can\\n\\ncontain several variable references, as well as some invariant text. For example,\\n\\na_dirs := dira dirb\\n1_dirs := dir1 dir2\\n\\na_files := filea fileb\\n1_files := file1 file2\\n\\nifeq \"$(use_a)\" \"yes\"\\na1 := a\\nelse\\na1 := 1\\nendif\\n\\nifeq \"$(use_dirs)\" \"yes\"\\ndf := dirs\\nelse\\ndf := files\\nendif\\n\\ndirs := $($(a1)_$(df))\\n\\nwill give dirs the same value as a_dirs, 1_dirs, a_files or 1_files depending on the\\nsettings of use_a and use_dirs.\\n\\nComputed variable names can also be used in substitution references:\\n\\na_objects := a.o b.o c.o\\n1_objects := 1.o 2.o 3.o\\n\\nsources := $($(a1)_objects:.o=.c)\\n\\ndefines sources as either ‘a.c b.c c.c’ or ‘1.c 2.c 3.c’, depending on the value of a1.\\n\\nThe only restriction on this sort of use of nested variable references is that they cannot\\nspecify part of the name of a function to be called. This is because the test for a recognized\\nfunction name is done before the expansion of nested references. For example,\\n\\n\\x0c72\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nifdef do_sort\\nfunc := sort\\nelse\\nfunc := strip\\nendif\\n\\nbar := a d b g q c\\n\\nfoo := $($(func) $(bar))\\n\\nattempts to give ‘foo’ the value of the variable ‘sort a d b g q c’ or ‘strip a d b g q c’,\\nrather than giving ‘a d b g q c’ as the argument to either the sort or the strip function.\\nThis restriction could be removed in the future if that change is shown to be a good idea.\\nYou can also use computed variable names in the left-hand side of a variable assignment,\\n\\nor in a define directive, as in:\\n\\ndir = foo\\n$(dir)_sources := $(wildcard $(dir)/*.c)\\ndefine $(dir)_print =\\nlpr $($(dir)_sources)\\nendef\\n\\nThis example defines the variables ‘dir’, ‘foo_sources’, and ‘foo_print’.\\n\\nNote that nested variable references are quite different from recursively expanded vari-\\nables (see Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66), though both are used\\ntogether in complex ways when doing makefile programming.\\n\\n6.4 How Variables Get Their Values\\n\\nVariables can get values in several different ways:\\n\\n• You can specify an overriding value when you run make. See Section 9.5 [Overriding\\n\\nVariables], page 113.\\n\\n• You can specify a value in the makefile, either with an assignment (see Section 6.5\\n[Setting Variables], page 72) or with a verbatim definition (see Section 6.8 [Defining\\nMulti-Line Variables], page 76).\\n\\n• You can specify a short-lived value with the let function (see Section 8.5 [Let Function],\\npage 98) or with the foreach function (see Section 8.6 [Foreach Function], page 99).\\n• Variables in the environment become make variables. See Section 6.10 [Variables from\\n\\nthe Environment], page 77.\\n\\n• Several automatic variables are given new values for each rule. Each of these has a\\n\\nsingle conventional use. See Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130.\\n\\n• Several variables have constant initial values. See Section 10.3 [Variables Used by\\n\\nImplicit Rules], page 125.\\n\\n6.5 Setting Variables\\n\\nTo set a variable from the makefile, write a line starting with the variable name followed by\\none of the assignment operators ‘=’, ‘:=’, ‘::=’, or ‘:::=’. Whatever follows the operator\\nand any initial whitespace on the line becomes the value. For example,\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n73\\n\\nobjects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o\\n\\ndefines a variable named objects to contain the value ‘main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o’.\\nWhitespace around the variable name and immediately after the ‘=’ is ignored.\\n\\nVariables defined with ‘=’ are recursively expanded variables. Variables defined with\\n‘:=’ or ‘::=’ are simply expanded variables; these definitions can contain variable references\\nwhich will be expanded before the definition is made. Variables defined with ‘:::=’ are\\nimmediately expanded variables. The different assignment operators are described in See\\nSection 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66.\\n\\nThe variable name may contain function and variable references, which are expanded\\n\\nwhen the line is read to find the actual variable name to use.\\n\\nThere is no limit on the length of the value of a variable except the amount of memory\\non the computer. You can split the value of a variable into multiple physical lines for\\nreadability (see Section 3.1.1 [Splitting Long Lines], page 12).\\n\\nMost variable names are considered to have the empty string as a value if you have never\\nset them. Several variables have built-in initial values that are not empty, but you can set\\nthem in the usual ways (see Section 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125).\\nSeveral special variables are set automatically to a new value for each rule; these are called\\nthe automatic variables (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\nIf you’d like a variable to be set to a value only if it’s not already set, then you can\\nuse the shorthand operator ‘?=’ instead of ‘=’. These two settings of the variable ‘FOO’ are\\nidentical (see Section 8.11 [The origin Function], page 104):\\n\\nFOO ?= bar\\n\\nand\\n\\nifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)\\nFOO = bar\\nendif\\n\\nThe shell assignment operator ‘!=’ can be used to execute a shell script and set a variable\\nto its output. This operator first evaluates the right-hand side, then passes that result to\\nthe shell for execution. If the result of the execution ends in a newline, that one newline is\\nremoved; all other newlines are replaced by spaces. The resulting string is then placed into\\nthe named recursively-expanded variable. For example:\\n\\nhash != printf ’\\\\043’\\nfile_list != find . -name ’*.c’\\n\\nIf the result of the execution could produce a $, and you don’t intend what follows that\\nto be interpreted as a make variable or function reference, then you must replace every $\\nwith $$ as part of the execution. Alternatively, you can set a simply expanded variable to\\nthe result of running a program using the shell function call. See Section 8.14 [The shell\\nFunction], page 107. For example:\\n\\nhash := $(shell printf ’\\\\043’)\\nvar := $(shell find . -name \"*.c\")\\n\\nAs with the shell function, the exit status of the just-invoked shell script is stored in\\n\\nthe .SHELLSTATUS variable.\\n\\n\\x0c74\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n6.6 Appending More Text to Variables\\n\\nOften it is useful to add more text to the value of a variable already defined. You do this\\nwith a line containing ‘+=’, like this:\\nobjects += another.o\\n\\nThis takes the value of the variable objects, and adds the text ‘another.o’ to it (preceded\\nby a single space, if it has a value already). Thus:\\nobjects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o\\nobjects += another.o\\n\\nsets objects to ‘main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o another.o’.\\n\\nUsing ‘+=’ is similar to:\\n\\nobjects = main.o foo.o bar.o utils.o\\nobjects := $(objects) another.o\\n\\nbut differs in ways that become important when you use more complex values.\\n\\nWhen the variable in question has not been defined before, ‘+=’ acts just like normal\\n‘=’:\\nit defines a recursively-expanded variable. However, when there is a previous defini-\\ntion, exactly what ‘+=’ does depends on what flavor of variable you defined originally. See\\nSection 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66, for an explanation of the two flavors\\nof variables.\\n\\nWhen you add to a variable’s value with ‘+=’, make acts essentially as if you had included\\nthe extra text in the initial definition of the variable. If you defined it first with ‘:=’ or ‘::=’,\\nmaking it a simply-expanded variable, ‘+=’ adds to that simply-expanded definition, and\\nexpands the new text before appending it to the old value just as ‘:=’ does (see Section 6.5\\n[Setting Variables], page 72, for a full explanation of ‘:=’ or ‘::=’). In fact,\\n\\nvariable := value\\nvariable += more\\n\\nis exactly equivalent to:\\n\\nvariable := value\\nvariable := $(variable) more\\n\\nOn the other hand, when you use ‘+=’ with a variable that you defined first to be\\nrecursively-expanded using plain ‘=’ or ‘:::=’, make appends the un-expanded text to the\\nexisting value, whatever it is. This means that\\n\\nvariable = value\\nvariable += more\\nis roughly equivalent to:\\n\\ntemp = value\\nvariable = $(temp) more\\n\\nexcept that of course it never defines a variable called temp. The importance of this comes\\nwhen the variable’s old value contains variable references. Take this common example:\\n\\nCFLAGS = $(includes) -O\\n...\\nCFLAGS += -pg # enable profiling\\n\\nThe first line defines the CFLAGS variable with a reference to another variable, includes.\\n(CFLAGS is used by the rules for C compilation; see Section 10.2 [Catalogue of Built-In\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n75\\n\\nRules], page 122.) Using ‘=’ for the definition makes CFLAGS a recursively-expanded variable,\\nmeaning ‘$(includes) -O’ is not expanded when make processes the definition of CFLAGS.\\nThus, includes need not be defined yet for its value to take effect. It only has to be defined\\nbefore any reference to CFLAGS. If we tried to append to the value of CFLAGS without using\\n‘+=’, we might do it like this:\\n\\nCFLAGS := $(CFLAGS) -pg # enable profiling\\n\\nThis is pretty close, but not quite what we want. Using ‘:=’ redefines CFLAGS as a simply-\\nexpanded variable; this means make expands the text ‘$(CFLAGS) -pg’ before setting the\\nvariable. If includes is not yet defined, we get ‘ -O -pg’, and a later definition of includes\\nwill have no effect. Conversely, by using ‘+=’ we set CFLAGS to the unexpanded value\\n‘$(includes) -O -pg’. Thus we preserve the reference to includes, so if that variable gets\\ndefined at any later point, a reference like ‘$(CFLAGS)’ still uses its value.\\n\\n6.7 The override Directive\\nIf a variable has been set with a command argument (see Section 9.5 [Overriding Variables],\\npage 113), then ordinary assignments in the makefile are ignored. If you want to set the\\nvariable in the makefile even though it was set with a command argument, you can use an\\noverride directive, which is a line that looks like this:\\n\\noverride variable = value\\n\\nor\\n\\noverride variable := value\\n\\nTo append more text to a variable defined on the command line, use:\\n\\noverride variable += more text\\n\\nSee Section 6.6 [Appending More Text to Variables], page 74.\\n\\nVariable assignments marked with the override flag have a higher priority than all other\\nassignments, except another override. Subsequent assignments or appends to this variable\\nwhich are not marked override will be ignored.\\n\\nThe override directive was not invented for escalation in the war between makefiles\\nand command arguments. It was invented so you can alter and add to values that the user\\nspecifies with command arguments.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you always want the ‘-g’ switch when you run the C compiler, but\\nyou would like to allow the user to specify the other switches with a command argument\\njust as usual. You could use this override directive:\\n\\noverride CFLAGS += -g\\n\\nYou can also use override directives with define directives. This is done as you might\\n\\nexpect:\\n\\noverride define foo =\\nbar\\nendef\\n\\nSee the next section for information about define.\\n\\n\\x0c76\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n6.8 Defining Multi-Line Variables\\n\\nAnother way to set the value of a variable is to use the define directive. This directive\\nhas an unusual syntax which allows newline characters to be included in the value, which\\nis convenient for defining both canned sequences of commands (see Section 5.8 [Defining\\nCanned Recipes], page 61), and also sections of makefile syntax to use with eval (see\\nSection 8.10 [Eval Function], page 103).\\n\\nThe define directive is followed on the same line by the name of the variable being\\ndefined and an (optional) assignment operator, and nothing more. The value to give the\\nvariable appears on the following lines. The end of the value is marked by a line containing\\njust the word endef.\\n\\nAside from this difference in syntax, define works just like any other variable definition.\\nThe variable name may contain function and variable references, which are expanded when\\nthe directive is read to find the actual variable name to use.\\n\\nThe final newline before the endef is not included in the value; if you want your value\\nto contain a trailing newline you must include a blank line. For example in order to define\\na variable that contains a newline character you must use two empty lines, not one:\\n\\ndefine newline\\n\\nendef\\n\\nYou may omit the variable assignment operator if you prefer. If omitted, make assumes\\nit to be ‘=’ and creates a recursively-expanded variable (see Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors\\nof Variables], page 66). When using a ‘+=’ operator, the value is appended to the previous\\nvalue as with any other append operation: with a single space separating the old and new\\nvalues.\\n\\nYou may nest define directives: make will keep track of nested directives and report\\nan error if they are not all properly closed with endef. Note that lines beginning with\\nthe recipe prefix character are considered part of a recipe, so any define or endef strings\\nappearing on such a line will not be considered make directives.\\n\\ndefine two-lines\\necho foo\\necho $(bar)\\nendef\\n\\nWhen used in a recipe, the previous example is functionally equivalent to this:\\n\\ntwo-lines = echo foo; echo $(bar)\\n\\nsince two commands separated by semicolon behave much like two separate shell commands.\\nHowever, note that using two separate lines means make will invoke the shell twice, running\\nan independent sub-shell for each line. See Section 5.3 [Recipe Execution], page 48.\\n\\nIf you want variable definitions made with define to take precedence over command-line\\n\\nvariable definitions, you can use the override directive together with define:\\n\\noverride define two-lines =\\nfoo\\n$(bar)\\nendef\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n77\\n\\nSee Section 6.7 [The override Directive], page 75.\\n\\n6.9 Undefining Variables\\n\\nIf you want to clear a variable, setting its value to empty is usually sufficient. Expanding\\nsuch a variable will yield the same result (empty string) regardless of whether it was set or\\nnot. However, if you are using the flavor (see Section 8.12 [Flavor Function], page 105)\\nand origin (see Section 8.11 [Origin Function], page 104) functions, there is a difference\\nbetween a variable that was never set and a variable with an empty value. In such situations\\nyou may want to use the undefine directive to make a variable appear as if it was never\\nset. For example:\\n\\nfoo := foo\\nbar = bar\\n\\nundefine foo\\nundefine bar\\n\\n$(info $(origin foo))\\n$(info $(flavor bar))\\n\\nThis example will print “undefined” for both variables.\\nIf you want to undefine a command-line variable definition, you can use the override\\n\\ndirective together with undefine, similar to how this is done for variable definitions:\\n\\noverride undefine CFLAGS\\n\\n6.10 Variables from the Environment\\n\\nVariables in make can come from the environment in which make is run. Every environment\\nvariable that make sees when it starts up is transformed into a make variable with the same\\nname and value. However, an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command\\nargument, overrides the environment. (If the ‘-e’ flag is specified, then values from the\\nenvironment override assignments in the makefile. See Section 9.8 [Summary of Options],\\npage 114. But this is not recommended practice.)\\n\\nThus, by setting the variable CFLAGS in your environment, you can cause all C compi-\\nlations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you prefer. This is safe for variables\\nwith standard or conventional meanings because you know that no makefile will use them\\nfor other things. (Note this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set CFLAGS explicitly and\\ntherefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)\\n\\nWhen make runs a recipe, some variables defined in the makefile are placed into the\\nenvironment of each command make invokes. By default, only variables that came from\\nthe make’s environment or set on its command line are placed into the environment of the\\ncommands. You can use the export directive to pass other variables. See Section 5.7.2\\n[Communicating Variables to a Sub-make], page 57, for full details.\\n\\nOther use of variables from the environment is not recommended.\\n\\nIt is not wise for\\nmakefiles to depend for their functioning on environment variables set up outside their\\ncontrol, since this would cause different users to get different results from the same makefile.\\nThis is against the whole purpose of most makefiles.\\n\\n\\x0c78\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nSuch problems would be especially likely with the variable SHELL, which is normally\\npresent in the environment to specify the user’s choice of interactive shell. It would be very\\nundesirable for this choice to affect make; so, make handles the SHELL environment variable\\nin a special way; see Section 5.3.2 [Choosing the Shell], page 49.\\n\\n6.11 Target-specific Variable Values\\n\\nVariable values in make are usually global; that is, they are the same regardless of where\\nthey are evaluated (unless they’re reset, of course). Exceptions to that are variables defined\\nwith the let function (see Section 8.5 [Let Function], page 98) or the foreach function\\n(see Section 8.6 [Foreach Function], page 99, and automatic variables (see Section 10.5.3\\n[Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\nAnother exception are target-specific variable values. This feature allows you to define\\ndifferent values for the same variable, based on the target that make is currently building.\\nAs with automatic variables, these values are only available within the context of a target’s\\nrecipe (and in other target-specific assignments).\\n\\nSet a target-specific variable value like this:\\n\\ntarget ... : variable-assignment\\n\\nTarget-specific variable assignments can be prefixed with any or all of the special key-\\nwords export, unexport, override, or private; these apply their normal behavior to this\\ninstance of the variable only.\\n\\nMultiple target values create a target-specific variable value for each member of the\\n\\ntarget list individually.\\n\\nThe variable-assignment can be any valid form of assignment; recursive (‘=’), simple\\n(‘:=’ or ‘::=’), immediate (‘::=’), appending (‘+=’), or conditional (‘?=’). All variables\\nthat appear within the variable-assignment are evaluated within the context of the target:\\nthus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values will be in effect. Note that this\\nvariable is actually distinct from any “global” value: the two variables do not have to have\\nthe same flavor (recursive vs. simple).\\n\\nTarget-specific variables have the same priority as any other makefile variable. Variables\\nprovided on the command line (and in the environment if the ‘-e’ option is in force) will\\ntake precedence. Specifying the override directive will allow the target-specific variable\\nvalue to be preferred.\\n\\nThere is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when you define a target-\\nspecific variable that variable value is also in effect for all prerequisites of this target, and\\nall their prerequisites, etc. (unless those prerequisites override that variable with their own\\ntarget-specific variable value). So, for example, a statement like this:\\n\\nprog : CFLAGS = -g\\nprog : prog.o foo.o bar.o\\n\\nwill set CFLAGS to ‘-g’ in the recipe for prog, but it will also set CFLAGS to ‘-g’ in the recipes\\nthat create prog.o, foo.o, and bar.o, and any recipes which create their prerequisites.\\n\\nBe aware that a given prerequisite will only be built once per invocation of make, at\\nmost. If the same file is a prerequisite of multiple targets, and each of those targets has\\na different value for the same target-specific variable, then the first target to be built will\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n79\\n\\ncause that prerequisite to be built and the prerequisite will inherit the target-specific value\\nfrom the first target. It will ignore the target-specific values from any other targets.\\n\\n6.12 Pattern-specific Variable Values\\n\\nIn addition to target-specific variable values (see Section 6.11 [Target-specific Variable Val-\\nues], page 78), GNU make supports pattern-specific variable values.\\nIn this form, the\\nvariable is defined for any target that matches the pattern specified.\\n\\nSet a pattern-specific variable value like this:\\n\\npattern ... : variable-assignment\\n\\nwhere pattern is a %-pattern. As with target-specific variable values, multiple pattern\\nvalues create a pattern-specific variable value for each pattern individually. The variable-\\nassignment can be any valid form of assignment. Any command line variable setting will\\ntake precedence, unless override is specified.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n%.o : CFLAGS = -O\\n\\nwill assign CFLAGS the value of ‘-O’ for all targets matching the pattern %.o.\\n\\nIf a target matches more than one pattern, the matching pattern-specific variables with\\nlonger stems are interpreted first. This results in more specific variables taking precedence\\nover the more generic ones, for example:\\n\\n%.o: %.c\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\nlib/%.o: CFLAGS := -fPIC -g\\n%.o: CFLAGS := -g\\n\\nall: foo.o lib/bar.o\\n\\nIn this example the first definition of the CFLAGS variable will be used to update\\nlib/bar.o even though the second one also applies to this target. Pattern-specific\\nvariables which result in the same stem length are considered in the order in which they\\nwere defined in the makefile.\\n\\nPattern-specific variables are searched after any target-specific variables defined explic-\\n\\nitly for that target, and before target-specific variables defined for the parent target.\\n\\n6.13 Suppressing Inheritance\\n\\nAs described in previous sections, make variables are inherited by prerequisites. This capa-\\nbility allows you to modify the behavior of a prerequisite based on which targets caused it\\nto be rebuilt. For example, you might set a target-specific variable on a debug target, then\\nrunning ‘make debug’ will cause that variable to be inherited by all prerequisites of debug,\\nwhile just running ‘make all’ (for example) would not have that assignment.\\n\\nSometimes, however, you may not want a variable to be inherited. For these situations,\\nmake provides the private modifier. Although this modifier can be used with any variable\\nassignment, it makes the most sense with target- and pattern-specific variables. Any variable\\nmarked private will be visible to its local target but will not be inherited by prerequisites\\n\\n\\x0c80\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nof that target. A global variable marked private will be visible in the global scope but will\\nnot be inherited by any target, and hence will not be visible in any recipe.\\n\\nAs an example, consider this makefile:\\n\\nEXTRA_CFLAGS =\\n\\nprog: private EXTRA_CFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib\\nprog: a.o b.o\\n\\nDue to the private modifier, a.o and b.o will not inherit the EXTRA_CFLAGS variable\\n\\nassignment from the prog target.\\n\\n6.14 Other Special Variables\\n\\nGNU make supports some variables that have special properties.\\n\\nMAKEFILE_LIST\\n\\nContains the name of each makefile that is parsed by make, in the order in\\nwhich it was parsed. The name is appended just before make begins to parse\\nthe makefile. Thus, if the first thing a makefile does is examine the last word\\nin this variable, it will be the name of the current makefile. Once the current\\nmakefile has used include, however, the last word will be the just-included\\nmakefile.\\n\\nIf a makefile named Makefile has this content:\\n\\nname1 := $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))\\n\\ninclude inc.mk\\n\\nname2 := $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))\\n\\nall:\\n\\n@echo name1 = $(name1)\\n@echo name2 = $(name2)\\n\\nthen you would expect to see this output:\\n\\nname1 = Makefile\\nname2 = inc.mk\\n\\n.DEFAULT_GOAL\\n\\nSets the default goal to be used if no targets were specified on the command line\\n(see Section 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals], page 109). The .DEFAULT_\\nGOAL variable allows you to discover the current default goal, restart the default\\ngoal selection algorithm by clearing its value, or to explicitly set the default goal.\\nThe following example illustrates these cases:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 6: How to Use Variables\\n\\n81\\n\\n# Query the default goal.\\nifeq ($(.DEFAULT_GOAL),)\\n\\n$(warning no default goal is set)\\n\\nendif\\n\\n.PHONY: foo\\nfoo: ; @echo $@\\n\\n$(warning default goal is $(.DEFAULT_GOAL))\\n\\n# Reset the default goal.\\n.DEFAULT_GOAL :=\\n\\n.PHONY: bar\\nbar: ; @echo $@\\n\\n$(warning default goal is $(.DEFAULT_GOAL))\\n\\n# Set our own.\\n.DEFAULT_GOAL := foo\\n\\nThis makefile prints:\\n\\nno default goal is set\\ndefault goal is foo\\ndefault goal is bar\\nfoo\\n\\nNote that assigning more than one target name to .DEFAULT_GOAL is invalid\\nand will result in an error.\\n\\nMAKE_RESTARTS\\n\\nThis variable is set only if this instance of make has restarted (see Section 3.5\\n[How Makefiles Are Remade], page 15): it will contain the number of times this\\ninstance has restarted. Note this is not the same as recursion (counted by the\\nMAKELEVEL variable). You should not set, modify, or export this variable.\\n\\nMAKE_TERMOUT\\nMAKE_TERMERR\\n\\nWhen make starts it will check whether stdout and stderr will show their output\\non a terminal. If so, it will set MAKE_TERMOUT and MAKE_TERMERR, respectively,\\nto the name of the terminal device (or true if this cannot be determined). If set\\nthese variables will be marked for export. These variables will not be changed\\nby make and they will not be modified if already set.\\nThese values can be used (particularly in combination with output synchroniza-\\ntion (see Section 5.4.2 [Output During Parallel Execution], page 53) to deter-\\nmine whether make itself is writing to a terminal; they can be tested to decide\\nwhether to force recipe commands to generate colorized output for example.\\nIf you invoke a sub-make and redirect its stdout or stderr it is your responsibility\\nto reset or unexport these variables as well, if your makefiles rely on them.\\n\\n\\x0c82\\n\\n.RECIPEPREFIX\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n.VARIABLES\\n\\n.FEATURES\\n\\nThe first character of the value of this variable is used as the character make\\nassumes is introducing a recipe line. If the variable is empty (as it is by de-\\nfault) that character is the standard tab character. For example, this is a valid\\nmakefile:\\n\\n.RECIPEPREFIX = >\\nall:\\n> @echo Hello, world\\n\\nThe value of .RECIPEPREFIX can be changed multiple times; once set it stays\\nin effect for all rules parsed until it is modified.\\n\\nExpands to a list of the names of all global variables defined so far. This\\nincludes variables which have empty values, as well as built-in variables (see\\nSection 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125), but does not include\\nany variables which are only defined in a target-specific context. Note that any\\nvalue you assign to this variable will be ignored; it will always return its special\\nvalue.\\n\\nExpands to a list of special features supported by this version of make.

Note that modifying this\\nvariable’s value does not change the list of directories which are searched.\\n\\n.EXTRA_PREREQS\\n\\nEach word in this variable is a new prerequisite which is added to targets for\\nwhich it is set. These prerequisites differ from normal prerequisites in that they\\ndo not appear in any of the automatic variables (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic\\nVariables], page 130). This allows prerequisites to be defined which do not\\nimpact the recipe.\\n\\nConsider a rule to link a program:\\n\\nmyprog: myprog.o file1.o file2.o\\n\\n$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)\\n\\n\\x0c84\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nNow suppose you want to enhance this makefile to ensure that updates to the\\ncompiler cause the program to be re-linked. You can add the compiler as a\\nprerequisite, but you must ensure that it’s not passed as an argument to link\\ncommand. You’ll need something like this:\\n\\nmyprog: myprog.o file1.o file2.o $(CC)\\n\\n$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ \\\\\\n\\n$(filter-out $(CC),$^) $(LDLIBS)\\nThen consider having multiple extra prerequisites: they would all have to be\\nfiltered out. Using .EXTRA_PREREQS and target-specific variables provides a\\nsimpler solution:\\n\\nmyprog: myprog.o file1.o file2.o\\n\\n$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LDLIBS)\\n\\nmyprog: .EXTRA_PREREQS = $(CC)\\n\\nThis feature can also be useful if you want to add prerequisites to a makefile\\nyou cannot easily modify: you can create a new file such as extra.mk:\\n\\nmyprog: .EXTRA_PREREQS = $(CC)\\n\\nthen invoke make -f extra.mk -f Makefile.\\nSetting .EXTRA_PREREQS globally will cause those prerequisites to be added to\\nall targets (which did not themselves override it with a target-specific value).\\nNote make is smart enough not to add a prerequisite listed in .EXTRA_PREREQS\\nas a prerequisite to itself.\\n\\n\\x0c85\\n\\n7 Conditional Parts of Makefiles\\n\\nA conditional directive causes part of a makefile to be obeyed or ignored depending on the\\nvalues of variables. Conditionals can compare the value of one variable to another, or the\\nvalue of a variable to a constant string. Conditionals control what make actually “sees” in\\nthe makefile, so they cannot be used to control recipes at the time of execution.\\n\\n7.1 Example of a Conditional\\n\\nThe following example of a conditional tells make to use one set of libraries if the CC variable\\nis ‘gcc’, and a different set of libraries otherwise. It works by controlling which of two recipe\\nlines will be used for the rule. The result is that ‘CC=gcc’ as an argument to make changes\\nnot only which compiler is used but also which libraries are linked.\\n\\nlibs_for_gcc = -lgnu\\nnormal_libs =\\n\\nfoo: $(objects)\\nifeq ($(CC),gcc)\\n\\n$(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)\\n\\n$(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)\\n\\nelse\\n\\nendif\\n\\nThis conditional uses three directives: one ifeq, one else and one endif.\\n\\nThe ifeq directive begins the conditional, and specifies the condition. It contains two\\narguments, separated by a comma and surrounded by parentheses. Variable substitution\\nis performed on both arguments and then they are compared. The lines of the makefile\\nfollowing the ifeq are obeyed if the two arguments match; otherwise they are ignored.\\n\\nThe else directive causes the following lines to be obeyed if the previous conditional\\nIn the example above, this means that the second alternative linking command\\nIt is optional to have an else in a\\n\\nfailed.\\nis used whenever the first alternative is not used.\\nconditional.\\n\\nThe endif directive ends the conditional. Every conditional must end with an endif.\\n\\nUnconditional makefile text follows.\\n\\nAs this example illustrates, conditionals work at the textual level: the lines of the con-\\nditional are treated as part of the makefile, or ignored, according to the condition. This is\\nwhy the larger syntactic units of the makefile, such as rules, may cross the beginning or the\\nend of the conditional.\\n\\nWhen the variable CC has the value ‘gcc’, the above example has this effect:\\n\\nfoo: $(objects)\\n\\n$(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)\\n\\nWhen the variable CC has any other value, the effect is this:\\n\\nfoo: $(objects)\\n\\n$(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)\\n\\n\\x0c86\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nEquivalent results can be obtained in another way by conditionalizing a variable assign-\\n\\nment and then using the variable unconditionally:\\n\\nlibs_for_gcc = -lgnu\\nnormal_libs =\\n\\nifeq ($(CC),gcc)\\n\\nlibs=$(libs_for_gcc)\\n\\nelse\\n\\nlibs=$(normal_libs)\\n\\nendif\\n\\nfoo: $(objects)\\n\\n$(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs)\\n\\n7.2 Syntax of Conditionals\\n\\nThe syntax of a simple conditional with no else is as follows:\\n\\nconditional-directive\\ntext-if-true\\nendif\\n\\nThe text-if-true may be any lines of text, to be considered as part of the makefile if the\\ncondition is true. If the condition is false, no text is used instead.\\n\\nThe syntax of a complex conditional is as follows:\\n\\nconditional-directive\\ntext-if-true\\nelse\\ntext-if-false\\nendif\\n\\nor:\\n\\nconditional-directive-one\\ntext-if-one-is-true\\nelse conditional-directive-two\\ntext-if-two-is-true\\nelse\\ntext-if-one-and-two-are-false\\nendif\\n\\nThere can be as many “else conditional-directive” clauses as necessary. Once a given\\ncondition is true, text-if-true is used and no other clause is used; if no condition is true then\\ntext-if-false is used. The text-if-true and text-if-false can be any number of lines of text.\\n\\nThe syntax of the conditional-directive is the same whether the conditional is simple\\nor complex; after an else or not. There are four different directives that test different\\nconditions. Here is a table of them:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 7: Conditional Parts of Makefiles\\n\\n87\\n\\nifeq (arg1, arg2)\\nifeq ’arg1’ ’arg2’\\nifeq \"arg1\" \"arg2\"\\nifeq \"arg1\" ’arg2’\\nifeq ’arg1’ \"arg2\"\\n\\nExpand all variable references in arg1 and arg2 and compare them.\\nIf they\\nare identical, the text-if-true is effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is\\neffective.\\n\\nOften you want to test if a variable has a non-empty value. When the value\\nresults from complex expansions of variables and functions, expansions you\\nwould consider empty may actually contain whitespace characters and thus are\\nnot seen as empty. However, you can use the strip function (see Section 8.2\\n[Text Functions], page 92) to avoid interpreting whitespace as a non-empty\\nvalue. For example:\\n\\nifeq ($(strip $(foo)),)\\ntext-if-empty\\nendif\\n\\nwill evaluate text-if-empty even if the expansion of $(foo) contains whitespace\\ncharacters.\\n\\nifneq (arg1, arg2)\\nifneq ’arg1’ ’arg2’\\nifneq \"arg1\" \"arg2\"\\nifneq \"arg1\" ’arg2’\\nifneq ’arg1’ \"arg2\"\\n\\nExpand all variable references in arg1 and arg2 and compare them.\\nIf they\\nare different, the text-if-true is effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is\\neffective.\\n\\nifdef variable-name\\n\\nThe ifdef form takes the name of a variable as its argument, not a reference to\\na variable. If the value of that variable has a non-empty value, the text-if-true\\nis effective; otherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is effective. Variables that have\\nnever been defined have an empty value. The text variable-name is expanded,\\nso it could be a variable or function that expands to the name of a variable.\\nFor example:\\n\\nbar = true\\nfoo = bar\\nifdef $(foo)\\nfrobozz = yes\\nendif\\n\\nThe variable reference $(foo) is expanded, yielding bar, which is considered\\nto be the name of a variable. The variable bar is not expanded, but its value\\nis examined to determine if it is non-empty.\\n\\nNote that ifdef only tests whether a variable has a value. It does not expand\\nthe variable to see if that value is nonempty. Consequently, tests using ifdef\\n\\n\\x0c88\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nreturn true for all definitions except those like foo =. To test for an empty\\nvalue, use ifeq ($(foo),). For example,\\n\\nbar =\\nfoo = $(bar)\\nifdef foo\\nfrobozz = yes\\nelse\\nfrobozz = no\\nendif\\n\\nsets ‘frobozz’ to ‘yes’, while:\\n\\nfoo =\\nifdef foo\\nfrobozz = yes\\nelse\\nfrobozz = no\\nendif\\n\\nsets ‘frobozz’ to ‘no’.\\n\\nifndef variable-name\\n\\nIf the variable variable-name has an empty value, the text-if-true is effective;\\notherwise, the text-if-false, if any, is effective. The rules for expansion and\\ntesting of variable-name are identical to the ifdef directive.\\n\\nExtra spaces are allowed and ignored at the beginning of the conditional directive line,\\nbut a tab is not allowed. (If the line begins with a tab, it will be considered part of a recipe\\nfor a rule.) Aside from this, extra spaces or tabs may be inserted with no effect anywhere\\nexcept within the directive name or within an argument. A comment starting with ‘#’ may\\nappear at the end of the line.\\n\\nThe other two directives that play a part in a conditional are else and endif. Each of\\nthese directives is written as one word, with no arguments. Extra spaces are allowed and\\nignored at the beginning of the line, and spaces or tabs at the end. A comment starting\\nwith ‘#’ may appear at the end of the line.\\n\\nConditionals affect which lines of the makefile make uses. If the condition is true, make\\nreads the lines of the text-if-true as part of the makefile; if the condition is false, make\\nignores those lines completely. It follows that syntactic units of the makefile, such as rules,\\nmay safely be split across the beginning or the end of the conditional.\\n\\nmake evaluates conditionals when it reads a makefile. Consequently, you cannot use\\nautomatic variables in the tests of conditionals because they are not defined until recipes\\nare run (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\nTo prevent intolerable confusion, it is not permitted to start a conditional in one makefile\\nand end it in another. However, you may write an include directive within a conditional,\\nprovided you do not attempt to terminate the conditional inside the included file.\\n\\n7.3 Conditionals that Test Flags\\n\\nYou can write a conditional that tests make command flags such as ‘-t’ by using the variable\\nMAKEFLAGS together with the findstring function (see Section 8.2 [Functions for String\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 7: Conditional Parts of Makefiles\\n\\n89\\n\\nSubstitution and Analysis], page 92). This is useful when touch is not enough to make a\\nfile appear up to date.\\n\\nRecall that MAKEFLAGS will put all single-letter options (such as ‘-t’) into the first word,\\nand that word will be empty if no single-letter options were given. To work with this, it’s\\nhelpful to add a value at the start to ensure there’s a word: for example ‘-$(MAKEFLAGS)’.\\nThe findstring function determines whether one string appears as a substring of an-\\nother. If you want to test for the ‘-t’ flag, use ‘t’ as the first string and the first word of\\nMAKEFLAGS as the other.\\n\\nFor example, here is how to arrange to use ‘ranlib -t’ to finish marking an archive file\\n\\nup to date:\\n\\narchive.a: ...\\nifneq (,$(findstring t,$(firstword -$(MAKEFLAGS))))\\n\\n+touch archive.a\\n+ranlib -t archive.a\\n\\nranlib archive.a\\n\\nelse\\n\\nendif\\n\\nThe ‘+’ prefix marks those recipe lines as “recursive” so that they will be executed despite\\nuse of the ‘-t’ flag. See Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c91\\n\\n8 Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\nFunctions allow you to do text processing in the makefile to compute the files to operate\\non or the commands to use in recipes. You use a function in a function call, where you\\ngive the name of the function and some text (the arguments) for the function to operate\\non. The result of the function’s processing is substituted into the makefile at the point of\\nthe call, just as a variable might be substituted.\\n\\n8.1 Function Call Syntax\\n\\nA function call resembles a variable reference. It can appear anywhere a variable reference\\ncan appear, and it is expanded using the same rules as variable references. A function call\\nlooks like this:\\n\\n$(function arguments)\\n\\nor like this:\\n\\n${function arguments}\\n\\nHere function is a function name; one of a short list of names that are part of make. You\\n\\ncan also essentially create your own functions by using the call built-in function.\\n\\nThe arguments are the arguments of the function. They are separated from the function\\nname by one or more spaces or tabs, and if there is more than one argument, then they are\\nseparated by commas. Such whitespace and commas are not part of an argument’s value.\\nThe delimiters which you use to surround the function call, whether parentheses or braces,\\ncan appear in an argument only in matching pairs; the other kind of delimiters may appear\\nsingly. If the arguments themselves contain other function calls or variable references, it is\\nwisest to use the same kind of delimiters for all the references; write ‘$(subst a,b,$(x))’,\\nnot ‘$(subst a,b,${x})’. This is because it is clearer, and because only one type of delim-\\niter is matched to find the end of the reference.\\n\\nEach argument is expanded before the function is invoked, unless otherwise noted below.\\n\\nThe substitution is done in the order in which the arguments appear.\\n\\nSpecial Characters\\nWhen using characters that are special to make as function arguments, you may need to\\nhide them. GNU make doesn’t support escaping characters with backslashes or other escape\\nsequences; however, because arguments are split before they are expanded you can hide them\\nby putting them into variables.\\n\\nCharacters you may need to hide include:\\n\\n• Commas\\n\\n• Initial whitespace in the first argument\\n\\n• Unmatched open parenthesis or brace\\n\\n• An open parenthesis or brace if you don’t want it to start a matched pair\\n\\nFor example, you can define variables comma and space whose values are isolated comma\\nand space characters, then substitute these variables where such characters are wanted, like\\nthis:\\n\\n\\x0c92\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ncomma:= ,\\nempty:=\\nspace:= $(empty) $(empty)\\nfoo:= a b c\\nbar:= $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))\\n# bar is now ‘a,b,c’.\\n\\nHere the subst function replaces each space with a comma, through the value of foo, and\\nsubstitutes the result.\\n\\n8.2 Functions for String Substitution and Analysis\\n\\nHere are some functions that operate on strings:\\n\\n$(subst from,to,text)\\n\\nPerforms a textual replacement on the text text: each occurrence of from is\\nreplaced by to. The result is substituted for the function call. For example,\\n\\n$(subst ee,EE,feet on the street)\\n\\nproduces the value ‘fEEt on the strEEt’.\\n\\n$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)\\n\\nFinds whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and replaces them\\nwith replacement. Here pattern may contain a ‘%’ which acts as a wildcard,\\nmatching any number of any characters within a word. If replacement also con-\\ntains a ‘%’, the ‘%’ is replaced by the text that matched the ‘%’ in pattern. Words\\nthat do not match the pattern are kept without change in the output. Only\\nthe first ‘%’ in the pattern and replacement is treated this way; any subsequent\\n‘%’ is unchanged.\\n‘%’ characters in patsubst function invocations can be quoted with preceding\\nbackslashes (‘\\\\’). Backslashes that would otherwise quote ‘%’ characters can be\\nquoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote ‘%’ characters or other\\nbackslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or\\nhas a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting ‘%’\\ncharacters go unmolested. For example, the pattern the\\\\%weird\\\\\\\\%pattern\\\\\\\\\\nhas ‘the%weird\\\\’ preceding the operative ‘%’ character, and ‘pattern\\\\\\\\’ fol-\\nlowing it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect\\nany ‘%’ character.\\nWhitespace between words is folded into single space characters; leading and\\ntrailing whitespace is discarded.\\nFor example,\\n\\n$(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)\\n\\nproduces the value ‘x.c.o bar.o’.\\nSubstitution references (see Section 6.3.1 [Substitution References], page 69)\\nare a simpler way to get the effect of the patsubst function:\\n\\n$(var:pattern=replacement)\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\n$(patsubst pattern,replacement,$(var))\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n93\\n\\nThe second shorthand simplifies one of the most common uses of patsubst:\\nreplacing the suffix at the end of file names.\\n$(var:suffix=replacement)\\n\\nis equivalent to\\n\\n$(patsubst %suffix,%replacement,$(var))\\n\\nFor example, you might have a list of object files:\\n\\nobjects = foo.o bar.o baz.o\\n\\nTo get the list of corresponding source files, you could simply write:\\n\\n$(objects:.o=.c)\\n\\ninstead of using the general form:\\n\\n$(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(objects))\\n\\n$(strip string)\\n\\nRemoves leading and trailing whitespace from string and replaces each inter-\\nnal sequence of one or more whitespace characters with a single space. Thus,\\n‘$(strip a b c )’ results in ‘a b c’.\\nThe function strip can be very useful when used in conjunction with condi-\\ntionals. When comparing something with the empty string ‘’ using ifeq or\\nifneq, you usually want a string of just whitespace to match the empty string\\n(see Chapter 7 [Conditionals], page 85).\\nThus, the following may fail to have the desired results:\\n\\n\"$(needs_made)\" \"\"\\n\\n.PHONY: all\\nifneq\\nall: $(needs_made)\\nelse\\nall:;@echo ’Nothing to make!’\\nendif\\n\\nReplacing the variable reference ‘$(needs_made)’ with the function call\\n‘$(strip $(needs_made))’ in the ifneq directive would make it more robust.\\n\\n$(findstring find,in)\\n\\nSearches in for an occurrence of find. If it occurs, the value is find; otherwise,\\nthe value is empty. You can use this function in a conditional to test for the\\npresence of a specific substring in a given string. Thus, the two examples,\\n\\n$(findstring a,a b c)\\n$(findstring a,b c)\\n\\nproduce the values ‘a’ and ‘’ (the empty string), respectively. See Section 7.3\\n[Testing Flags], page 88, for a practical application of findstring.\\n\\n$(filter pattern...,text)\\n\\nReturns all whitespace-separated words in text that do match any of the pattern\\nwords, removing any words that do not match. The patterns are written using\\n‘%’, just like the patterns used in the patsubst function above.\\nThe filter function can be used to separate out different types of strings (such\\nas file names) in a variable. For example:\\n\\nsources := foo.c bar.c baz.s ugh.h\\n\\n\\x0c94\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nfoo: $(sources)\\n\\ncc $(filter %.c %.s,$(sources)) -o foo\\nsays that foo depends of foo.c, bar.c, baz.s and ugh.h but only foo.c, bar.c\\nand baz.s should be specified in the command to the compiler.\\n\\n$(filter-out pattern...,text)\\n\\nReturns all whitespace-separated words in text that do not match any of the\\npattern words, removing the words that do match one or more. This is the\\nexact opposite of the filter function.\\nFor example, given:\\n\\nobjects=main1.o foo.o main2.o bar.o\\nmains=main1.o main2.o\\n\\nthe following generates a list which contains all the object files not in ‘mains’:\\n\\n$(filter-out $(mains),$(objects))\\n\\n$(sort list)\\n\\nSorts the words of list in lexical order, removing duplicate words. The output\\nis a list of words separated by single spaces. Thus,\\n\\n$(sort foo bar lose)\\n\\nreturns the value ‘bar foo lose’.\\nIncidentally, since sort removes duplicate words, you can use it for this purpose\\neven if you don’t care about the sort order.\\n\\n$(word n,text)\\n\\nReturns the nth word of text. The legitimate values of n start from 1. If n is\\nbigger than the number of words in text, the value is empty. For example,\\n\\n$(word 2, foo bar baz)\\n\\nreturns ‘bar’.\\n\\n$(wordlist s,e,text)\\n\\nReturns the list of words in text starting with word s and ending with word e\\n(inclusive). The legitimate values of s start from 1; e may start from 0. If s is\\nbigger than the number of words in text, the value is empty. If e is bigger than\\nthe number of words in text, words up to the end of text are returned. If s is\\ngreater than e, nothing is returned. For example,\\n\\n$(wordlist 2, 3, foo bar baz)\\n\\nreturns ‘bar baz’.\\n\\n$(words text)\\n\\nReturns the number of words in text. Thus, the last word of text is\\n$(word $(words text),text).\\n\\n$(firstword names...)\\n\\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace.\\nThe value is the first name in the series. The rest of the names are ignored.\\nFor example,\\n\\n$(firstword foo bar)\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n95\\n\\nproduces the result ‘foo’. Although $(firstword text) is the same as $(word\\n1,text), the firstword function is retained for its simplicity.\\n\\n$(lastword names...)\\n\\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace.\\nThe value is the last name in the series.\\nFor example,\\n\\n$(lastword foo bar)\\n\\nproduces the result ‘bar’. Although $(lastword text) is the same as $(word\\n$(words text),text), the lastword function was added for its simplicity and\\nbetter performance.\\n\\nHere is a realistic example of the use of subst and patsubst. Suppose that a makefile\\nuses the VPATH variable to specify a list of directories that make should search for prerequisite\\nfiles (see Section 4.4.1 [VPATH Search Path for All Prerequisites], page 27). This example\\nshows how to tell the C compiler to search for header files in the same list of directories.\\n\\nThe value of VPATH is a list of directories separated by colons, such as ‘src:../headers’.\\n\\nFirst, the subst function is used to change the colons to spaces:\\n\\n$(subst :, ,$(VPATH))\\n\\nThis produces ‘src ../headers’. Then patsubst is used to turn each directory name\\ninto a ‘-I’ flag. These can be added to the value of the variable CFLAGS, which is passed\\nautomatically to the C compiler, like this:\\n\\noverride CFLAGS += $(patsubst %,-I%,$(subst :, ,$(VPATH)))\\n\\nThe effect is to append the text ‘-Isrc -I../headers’ to the previously given value of\\nCFLAGS. The override directive is used so that the new value is assigned even if the\\nprevious value of CFLAGS was specified with a command argument (see Section 6.7 [The\\noverride Directive], page 75).\\n\\n8.3 Functions for File Names\\n\\nSeveral of the built-in expansion functions relate specifically to taking apart file names or\\nlists of file names.\\n\\nEach of the following functions performs a specific transformation on a file name. The\\nargument of the function is regarded as a series of file names, separated by whitespace.\\n(Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.) Each file name in the series is transformed in\\nthe same way and the results are concatenated with single spaces between them.\\n\\n$(dir names...)\\n\\nExtracts the directory-part of each file name in names. The directory-part of\\nthe file name is everything up through (and including) the last slash in it. If the\\nfile name contains no slash, the directory part is the string ‘./’. For example,\\n\\n$(dir src/foo.c hacks)\\n\\nproduces the result ‘src/ ./’.\\n\\n$(notdir names...)\\n\\nExtracts all but the directory-part of each file name in names. If the file name\\ncontains no slash, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, everything through the last\\nslash is removed from it.\\n\\n\\x0c96\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nA file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string. This is unfortunate,\\nbecause it means that the result does not always have the same number of\\nwhitespace-separated file names as the argument had; but we do not see any\\nother valid alternative.\\nFor example,\\n\\n$(notdir src/foo.c hacks)\\n\\nproduces the result ‘foo.c hacks’.\\n\\n$(suffix names...)\\n\\nExtracts the suffix of each file name in names. If the file name contains a period,\\nthe suffix is everything starting with the last period. Otherwise, the suffix is\\nthe empty string. This frequently means that the result will be empty when\\nnames is not, and if names contains multiple file names, the result may contain\\nfewer file names.\\nFor example,\\n\\n$(suffix src/foo.c src-1.0/bar.c hacks)\\n\\nproduces the result ‘.c .c’.\\n\\n$(basename names...)\\n\\nExtracts all but the suffix of each file name in names. If the file name contains\\na period, the basename is everything starting up to (and not including) the last\\nperiod. Periods in the directory part are ignored. If there is no period, the\\nbasename is the entire file name. For example,\\n\\n$(basename src/foo.c src-1.0/bar hacks)\\n\\nproduces the result ‘src/foo src-1.0/bar hacks’.\\n\\n$(addsuffix suffix,names...)\\n\\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace;\\nsuffix is used as a unit. The value of suffix is appended to the end of each\\nindividual name and the resulting larger names are concatenated with single\\nspaces between them. For example,\\n\\n$(addsuffix .c,foo bar)\\nproduces the result ‘foo.c bar.c’.\\n\\n$(addprefix prefix,names...)\\n\\nThe argument names is regarded as a series of names, separated by whitespace;\\nprefix is used as a unit. The value of prefix is prepended to the front of each\\nindividual name and the resulting larger names are concatenated with single\\nspaces between them. For example,\\n$(addprefix src/,foo bar)\\n\\nproduces the result ‘src/foo src/bar’.\\n\\n$(join list1,list2)\\n\\nConcatenates the two arguments word by word: the two first words (one from\\neach argument) concatenated form the first word of the result, the two second\\nwords form the second word of the result, and so on. So the nth word of the\\nresult comes from the nth word of each argument. If one argument has more\\nwords that the other, the extra words are copied unchanged into the result.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n97\\n\\nFor example, ‘$(join a b,.c .o)’ produces ‘a.c b.o’.\\nWhitespace between the words in the lists is not preserved; it is replaced with\\na single space.\\nThis function can merge the results of the dir and notdir functions, to produce\\nthe original list of files which was given to those two functions.\\n\\n$(wildcard pattern)\\n\\nThe argument pattern is a file name pattern, typically containing wildcard\\ncharacters (as in shell file name patterns). The result of wildcard is a\\nspace-separated list of the names of existing files that match the pattern. See\\nSection 4.3 [Using Wildcard Characters in File Names], page 25.\\n\\n$(realpath names...)\\n\\nFor each file name in names return the canonical absolute name. A canonical\\nname does not contain any . or .. components, nor any repeated path separa-\\ntors (/) or symlinks. In case of a failure the empty string is returned. Consult\\nthe realpath(3) documentation for a list of possible failure causes.\\n\\n$(abspath names...)\\n\\nFor each file name in names return an absolute name that does not contain\\nany . or .. components, nor any repeated path separators (/). Note that, in\\ncontrast to realpath function, abspath does not resolve symlinks and does not\\nrequire the file names to refer to an existing file or directory. Use the wildcard\\nfunction to test for existence.\\n\\n8.4 Functions for Conditionals\\n\\nThere are four functions that provide conditional expansion. A key aspect of these functions\\nis that not all of the arguments are expanded initially. Only those arguments which need\\nto be expanded, will be expanded.\\n\\n$(if condition,then-part[,else-part])\\n\\nThe if function provides support for conditional expansion in a functional\\ncontext (as opposed to the GNU make makefile conditionals such as ifeq (see\\nSection 7.2 [Syntax of Conditionals], page 86)).\\nThe first argument, condition, first has all preceding and trailing whitespace\\nstripped, then is expanded. If it expands to any non-empty string, then the con-\\ndition is considered to be true. If it expands to an empty string, the condition\\nis considered to be false.\\nIf the condition is true then the second argument, then-part, is evaluated and\\nthis is used as the result of the evaluation of the entire if function.\\nIf the condition is false then the third argument, else-part, is evaluated and this\\nis the result of the if function. If there is no third argument, the if function\\nevaluates to nothing (the empty string).\\nNote that only one of the then-part or the else-part will be evaluated, never\\nboth. Thus, either can contain side-effects (such as shell function calls, etc.)\\n\\n$(or condition1[,condition2[,condition3...]])\\n\\nThe or function provides a “short-circuiting” OR operation. Each argument\\nIf an argument expands to a non-empty string the\\nis expanded, in order.\\n\\n\\x0c98\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nprocessing stops and the result of the expansion is that string.\\nIf, after all\\narguments are expanded, all of them are false (empty), then the result of the\\nexpansion is the empty string.\\n\\n$(and condition1[,condition2[,condition3...]])\\n\\nThe and function provides a “short-circuiting” AND operation. Each argument\\nis expanded, in order. If an argument expands to an empty string the processing\\nstops and the result of the expansion is the empty string.\\nIf all arguments\\nexpand to a non-empty string then the result of the expansion is the expansion\\nof the last argument.\\n\\n$(intcmp lhs,rhs[,lt-part[,eq-part[,gt-part]]])\\n\\nThe intcmp function provides support for numerical comparison of integers.\\nThis function has no counterpart among the GNU make makefile conditionals.\\nThe left-hand side, lhs, and right-hand side, rhs, are expanded and parsed as\\nintegral numbers in base 10. Expansion of the remaining arguments is controlled\\nby how the numerical left-hand side compares to the numerical right-hand side.\\n\\nIf there are no further arguments, then the function expands to empty if the\\nleft-hand side and right-hand side do not compare equal, or to their numerical\\nvalue if they do compare equal.\\n\\nElse if the left-hand side is strictly less than the right-hand side, the intcmp\\nIf both\\nfunction evaluates to the expansion of the third argument, lt-part.\\nsides compare equal, then the intcmp function evaluates to the expansion of\\nthe fourth argument, eq-part. If the left-hand side is strictly greater than the\\nright-hand side, then the intcmp function evaluates to the expansion of the fifth\\nargument, gt-part.\\n\\nIf gt-part is missing, it defaults to eq-part.\\nIf eq-part is missing, it defaults\\nto the empty string. Thus both ‘$(intcmp 9,7,hello)’ and ‘$(intcmp\\n‘$(intcmp\\n9,7,hello,world,)’\\n9,7,hello,world)’ (notice the absence of a comma after world) evaluates to\\n‘world’.\\n\\nempty string, while\\n\\nevaluate\\n\\nto the\\n\\n8.5 The let Function\\nThe let function provides a means to limit the scope of a variable. The assignment of the\\nnamed variables in a let expression is in effect only within the text provided by the let\\nexpression, and this assignment doesn’t impact that named variable in any outer scope.\\n\\nAdditionally, the let function enables list unpacking by assigning all unassigned values\\n\\nto the last named variable.\\n\\nThe syntax of the let function is:\\n\\n$(let var [var ...],[list],text)\\n\\nThe first two arguments, var and list, are expanded before anything else is done; note that\\nthe last argument, text, is not expanded at the same time. Next, each word of the expanded\\nvalue of list is bound to each of the variable names, var, in turn, with the final variable\\nname being bound to the remainder of the expanded list. In other words, the first word of\\nlist is bound to the first variable var, the second word to the second variable var, and so on.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n99\\n\\nIf there are more variable names in var than there are words in list, the remaining var\\nvariable names are set to the empty string. If there are fewer vars than words in list then\\nthe last var is set to all remaining words in list.\\n\\nThe variables in var are assigned as simply-expanded variables during the execution of\\n\\nlet. See Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66.\\n\\nAfter all variables are thus bound, text is expanded to provide the result of the let\\n\\nfunction.\\n\\nFor example, this macro reverses the order of the words in the list that it is given as its\\n\\nfirst argument:\\n\\nreverse = $(let first rest,$1,\\\\\\n\\n$(if $(rest),$(call reverse,$(rest)) )$(first))\\n\\nall: ; @echo $(call reverse,d c b a)\\n\\nwill print a b c d. When first called, let will expand $1 to d c b a. It will then assign first\\nto d and assign rest to c b a. It will then expand the if-statement, where $(rest) is not\\nempty so we recursively invoke the reverse function with the value of rest which is now c b\\na. The recursive invocation of let assigns first to c and rest to b a. The recursion continues\\nuntil let is called with just a single value, a. Here first is a and rest is empty, so we do not\\nrecurse but simply expand $(first) to a and return, which adds b, etc.\\n\\nIf\\nAfter the reverse call is complete, the first and rest variables are no longer set.\\nvariables by those names existed beforehand, they are not affected by the expansion of the\\nreverse macro.\\n\\n8.6 The foreach Function\\nThe foreach function is similar to the let function, but very different from other functions.\\nIt causes one piece of text to be used repeatedly, each time with a different substitution\\nperformed on it. The foreach function resembles the for command in the shell sh and the\\nforeach command in the C-shell csh.\\n\\nThe syntax of the foreach function is:\\n\\n$(foreach var,list,text)\\n\\nThe first two arguments, var and list, are expanded before anything else is done; note that\\nthe last argument, text, is not expanded at the same time. Then for each word of the\\nexpanded value of list, the variable named by the expanded value of var is set to that word,\\nand text is expanded. Presumably text contains references to that variable, so its expansion\\nwill be different each time.\\n\\nThe result is that text is expanded as many times as there are whitespace-separated\\nwords in list. The multiple expansions of text are concatenated, with spaces between them,\\nto make the result of foreach.\\n\\nThis simple example sets the variable ‘files’ to the list of all files in the directories in\\n\\nthe list ‘dirs’:\\n\\ndirs := a b c d\\nfiles := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(wildcard $(dir)/*))\\n\\n\\x0c100\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nHere text is ‘$(wildcard $(dir)/*)’. The first repetition finds the value ‘a’ for dir, so\\nit produces the same result as ‘$(wildcard a/*)’; the second repetition produces the result\\nof ‘$(wildcard b/*)’; and the third, that of ‘$(wildcard c/*)’.\\n\\nThis example has the same result (except for setting ‘dirs’) as the following example:\\n\\nfiles := $(wildcard a/* b/* c/* d/*)\\n\\nWhen text is complicated, you can improve readability by giving it a name, with an\\n\\nadditional variable:\\n\\nfind_files = $(wildcard $(dir)/*)\\ndirs := a b c d\\nfiles := $(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(find_files))\\n\\nHere we use the variable find_files this way. We use plain ‘=’ to define a recursively-\\nexpanding variable, so that its value contains an actual function call to be re-expanded\\nunder the control of foreach; a simply-expanded variable would not do, since wildcard\\nwould be called only once at the time of defining find_files.\\n\\nLike the let function, the foreach function has no permanent effect on the variable var;\\nits value and flavor after the foreach function call are the same as they were beforehand.\\nThe other values which are taken from list are in effect only temporarily, during the exe-\\ncution of foreach. The variable var is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of\\nforeach. If var was undefined before the foreach function call, it is undefined after the\\ncall. See Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66.\\n\\nYou must take care when using complex variable expressions that result in variable\\nnames because many strange things are valid variable names, but are probably not what\\nyou intended. For example,\\n\\nfiles := $(foreach Esta-escrito-en-espanol!,b c ch,$(find_files))\\n\\nmight be useful\\nif the value of find_files references the variable whose name is\\n‘Esta-escrito-en-espanol!’ (es un nombre bastante largo, no?), but it is more likely to\\nbe a mistake.\\n\\n8.7 The file Function\\nThe file function allows the makefile to write to or read from a file. Two modes of\\nwriting are supported: overwrite, where the text is written to the beginning of the file and\\nany existing content is lost, and append, where the text is written to the end of the file,\\npreserving the existing content. In both cases the file is created if it does not exist. It is a\\nfatal error if the file cannot be opened for writing, or if the write operation fails. The file\\nfunction expands to the empty string when writing to a file.\\n\\nWhen reading from a file, the file function expands to the verbatim contents of the file,\\nexcept that the final newline (if there is one) will be stripped. Attempting to read from a\\nnon-existent file expands to the empty string.\\n\\nThe syntax of the file function is:\\n$(file op filename[,text])\\n\\nWhen the file function is evaluated all its arguments are expanded first, then the file\\n\\nindicated by filename will be opened in the mode described by op.\\n\\nThe operator op can be > to indicate the file will be overwritten with new content, >> to\\nindicate the current contents of the file will be appended to, or < to indicate the contents of\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n101\\n\\nthe file will be read in. The filename specifies the file to be written to or read from. There\\nmay optionally be whitespace between the operator and the file name.\\n\\nWhen reading files, it is an error to provide a text value.\\nWhen writing files, text will be written to the file. If text does not already end in a\\nnewline a final newline will be written (even if text is the empty string). If the text argument\\nis not given at all, nothing will be written.\\n\\nFor example, the file function can be useful if your build system has a limited command\\nline size and your recipe runs a command that can accept arguments from a file as well.\\nMany commands use the convention that an argument prefixed with an @ specifies a file\\ncontaining more arguments. Then you might write your recipe in this way:\\n\\nprogram: $(OBJECTS)\\n\\n$(file >$@.in,$^)\\n$(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in\\n@rm $@.in\\n\\nIf the command required each argument to be on a separate line of the input file, you\\n\\nmight write your recipe like this:\\n\\nprogram: $(OBJECTS)\\n\\n$(file >$@.in) $(foreach O,$^,$(file >>$@.in,$O))\\n$(CMD) $(CMDFLAGS) @$@.in\\n@rm $@.in\\n\\n8.8 The call Function\\nThe call function is unique in that it can be used to create new parameterized functions.\\nYou can write a complex expression as the value of a variable, then use call to expand it\\nwith different values.\\n\\nThe syntax of the call function is:\\n\\n$(call variable,param,param,...)\\n\\nWhen make expands this function, it assigns each param to temporary variables $(1),\\n$(2), etc. The variable $(0) will contain variable. There is no maximum number of\\nparameter arguments. There is no minimum, either, but it doesn’t make sense to use call\\nwith no parameters.\\n\\nThen variable is expanded as a make variable in the context of these temporary assign-\\nments. Thus, any reference to $(1) in the value of variable will resolve to the first param\\nin the invocation of call.\\n\\nNote that variable is the name of a variable, not a reference to that variable. Therefore\\nyou would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a\\nvariable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)\\n\\nIf variable is the name of a built-in function, the built-in function is always invoked (even\\n\\nif a make variable by that name also exists).\\n\\nThe call function expands the param arguments before assigning them to temporary\\nvariables. This means that variable values containing references to built-in functions that\\nhave special expansion rules, like foreach or if, may not work as you expect.\\n\\nSome examples may make this clearer.\\n\\n\\x0c102\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThis macro simply reverses its arguments:\\n\\nreverse = $(2) $(1)\\n\\nfoo = $(call reverse,a,b)\\n\\nHere foo will contain ‘b a’.\\n\\nThis one is slightly more interesting: it defines a macro to search for the first instance\\n\\nof a program in PATH:\\n\\npathsearch = $(firstword $(wildcard $(addsuffix /$(1),$(subst :, ,$(PATH)))))\\n\\nLS := $(call pathsearch,ls)\\n\\nNow the variable LS contains /bin/ls or similar.\\n\\nThe call function can be nested. Each recursive invocation gets its own local values for\\n$(1), etc. that mask the values of higher-level call. For example, here is an implementation\\nof a map function:\\n\\nmap = $(foreach a,$(2),$(call $(1),$(a)))\\n\\nNow you can map a function that normally takes only one argument, such as origin, to\\n\\nmultiple values in one step:\\n\\no = $(call map,origin,o map MAKE)\\n\\nand end up with o containing something like ‘file file default’.\\nA final caution: be careful when adding whitespace to the arguments to call. As with\\nother functions, any whitespace contained in the second and subsequent arguments is kept;\\nthis can cause strange effects. It’s generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace when\\nproviding parameters to call.\\n\\n8.9 The value Function\\nThe value function provides a way for you to use the value of a variable without having it\\nexpanded. Please note that this does not undo expansions which have already occurred; for\\nexample if you create a simply expanded variable its value is expanded during the definition;\\nin that case the value function will return the same result as using the variable directly.\\n\\nThe syntax of the value function is:\\n\\n$(value variable)\\n\\nNote that variable is the name of a variable, not a reference to that variable. Therefore\\nyou would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a\\nvariable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)\\n\\nThe result of this function is a string containing the value of variable, without any\\n\\nexpansion occurring. For example, in this makefile:\\n\\nFOO = $PATH\\n\\nall:\\n\\n@echo $(FOO)\\n@echo $(value FOO)\\n\\nThe first output line would be ATH, since the “$P” would be expanded as a make variable,\\nwhile the second output line would be the current value of your $PATH environment variable,\\nsince the value function avoided the expansion.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n103\\n\\nThe value function is most often used in conjunction with the eval function (see\\n\\nSection 8.10 [Eval Function], page 103).\\n\\n8.10 The eval Function\\nThe eval function is very special:\\nit allows you to define new makefile constructs that\\nare not constant; which are the result of evaluating other variables and functions. The\\nargument to the eval function is expanded, then the results of that expansion are parsed\\nas makefile syntax. The expanded results can define new make variables, targets, implicit\\nor explicit rules, etc.\\n\\nThe result of the eval function is always the empty string; thus, it can be placed virtually\\n\\nanywhere in a makefile without causing syntax errors.\\n\\nIt’s important to realize that the eval argument is expanded twice; first by the eval\\nfunction, then the results of that expansion are expanded again when they are parsed\\nas makefile syntax. This means you may need to provide extra levels of escaping for “$”\\ncharacters when using eval. The value function (see Section 8.9 [Value Function], page 102)\\ncan sometimes be useful in these situations, to circumvent unwanted expansions.\\n\\nHere is an example of how eval can be used; this example combines a number of concepts\\nand other functions. Although it might seem overly complex to use eval in this example,\\nrather than just writing out the rules, consider two things: first, the template definition (in\\nPROGRAM_template) could need to be much more complex than it is here; and second, you\\nmight put the complex, “generic” part of this example into another makefile, then include\\nit in all the individual makefiles. Now your individual makefiles are quite straightforward.\\n\\n\\x0c104\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nPROGRAMS\\n\\n= server client\\n\\nserver_OBJS = server.o server_priv.o server_access.o\\nserver_LIBS = priv protocol\\n\\nclient_OBJS = client.o client_api.o client_mem.o\\nclient_LIBS = protocol\\n\\n# Everything after this is generic\\n\\n.PHONY: all\\nall: $(PROGRAMS)\\n\\ndefine PROGRAM_template =\\n\\n$(1): $$($(1)_OBJS) $$($(1)_LIBS:%=-l%)\\n+= $$($(1)_OBJS)\\nALL_OBJS\\n\\nendef\\n\\n$(foreach prog,$(PROGRAMS),$(eval $(call PROGRAM_template,$(prog))))\\n\\n$(PROGRAMS):\\n\\n$(LINK.o) $^ $(LDLIBS) -o $@\\n\\nclean:\\n\\nrm -f $(ALL_OBJS) $(PROGRAMS)\\n\\n8.11 The origin Function\\nThe origin function is unlike most other functions in that it does not operate on the values\\nof variables; it tells you something about a variable. Specifically, it tells you where it came\\nfrom.\\n\\nThe syntax of the origin function is:\\n\\n$(origin variable)\\n\\nNote that variable is the name of a variable to inquire about, not a reference to that\\nvariable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You\\ncan, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a\\nconstant.)\\n\\nThe result of this function is a string telling you how the variable variable was defined:\\n\\n‘undefined’\\n\\nif variable was never defined.\\n\\n‘default’\\n\\nif variable has a default definition, as is usual with CC and so on. See Section 10.3\\n[Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125. Note that if you have redefined a\\ndefault variable, the origin function will return the origin of the later definition.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n105\\n\\n‘environment’\\n\\nif variable was inherited from the environment provided to make.\\n\\n‘environment override’\\n\\nif variable was inherited from the environment provided to make, and is over-\\nriding a setting for variable in the makefile as a result of the ‘-e’ option (see\\nSection 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114).\\n\\n‘file’\\n\\nif variable was defined in a makefile.\\n\\n‘command line’\\n\\nif variable was defined on the command line.\\n\\n‘override’\\n\\nif variable was defined with an override directive in a makefile (see Section 6.7\\n[The override Directive], page 75).\\n\\n‘automatic’\\n\\nif variable is an automatic variable defined for the execution of the recipe for\\neach rule (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\nThis information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to determine if you\\nwant to believe the value of a variable. For example, suppose you have a makefile foo that\\nincludes another makefile bar. You want a variable bletch to be defined in bar if you\\nrun the command ‘make -f bar’, even if the environment contains a definition of bletch.\\nHowever, if foo defined bletch before including bar, you do not want to override that\\ndefinition. This could be done by using an override directive in foo, giving that definition\\nprecedence over the later definition in bar; unfortunately, the override directive would\\nalso override any command line definitions. So, bar could include:\\n\\nifdef bletch\\nifeq \"$(origin bletch)\" \"environment\"\\nbletch = barf, gag, etc.\\nendif\\nendif\\n\\nIf bletch has been defined from the environment, this will redefine it.\\n\\nIf you want to override a previous definition of bletch if it came from the environment,\\n\\neven under ‘-e’, you could instead write:\\n\\nifneq \"$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))\" \"\"\\nbletch = barf, gag, etc.\\nendif\\n\\nHere the redefinition takes place if ‘$(origin bletch)’ returns either ‘environment’ or\\n‘environment override’. See Section 8.2 [Functions for String Substitution and Analysis],\\npage 92.\\n\\n8.12 The flavor Function\\nThe flavor function, like the origin function, does not operate on the values of variables\\nbut rather it tells you something about a variable. Specifically, it tells you the flavor of a\\nvariable (see Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66).\\n\\n\\x0c106\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThe syntax of the flavor function is:\\n\\n$(flavor variable)\\n\\nNote that variable is the name of a variable to inquire about, not a reference to that\\nvariable. Therefore you would not normally use a ‘$’ or parentheses when writing it. (You\\ncan, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a\\nconstant.)\\n\\nThe result of this function is a string that identifies the flavor of the variable variable:\\n\\n‘undefined’\\n\\nif variable was never defined.\\n\\n‘recursive’\\n\\nif variable is a recursively expanded variable.\\n\\n‘simple’\\n\\nif variable is a simply expanded variable.\\n\\n8.13 Functions That Control Make\\n\\nThese functions control the way make runs. Generally, they are used to provide information\\nto the user of the makefile or to cause make to stop if some sort of environmental error is\\ndetected.\\n\\n$(error text...)\\n\\nGenerates a fatal error where the message is text. Note that the error is gen-\\nerated whenever this function is evaluated. So, if you put it inside a recipe or\\non the right side of a recursive variable assignment, it won’t be evaluated until\\nlater. The text will be expanded before the error is generated.\\nFor example,\\n\\nifdef ERROR1\\n$(error error is $(ERROR1))\\nendif\\n\\nwill generate a fatal error during the read of the makefile if the make variable\\nERROR1 is defined. Or,\\n\\nERR = $(error found an error!)\\n\\n.PHONY: err\\nerr: ; $(ERR)\\n\\nwill generate a fatal error while make is running, if the err target is invoked.\\n\\n$(warning text...)\\n\\nThis function works similarly to the error function, above, except that make\\ndoesn’t exit. Instead, text is expanded and the resulting message is displayed,\\nbut processing of the makefile continues.\\nThe result of the expansion of this function is the empty string.\\n\\n$(info text...)\\n\\nThis function does nothing more than print its (expanded) argument(s) to stan-\\ndard output. No makefile name or line number is added. The result of the\\nexpansion of this function is the empty string.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 8: Functions for Transforming Text\\n\\n107\\n\\n8.14 The shell Function\\nThe shell function is unlike any other function other than the wildcard function (see\\nSection 4.3.3 [The Function wildcard], page 26) in that it communicates with the world\\noutside of make.\\n\\nThe shell function provides for make the same facility that backquotes (‘‘’) provide in\\nmost shells: it does command expansion. This means that it takes as an argument a shell\\ncommand and expands to the output of the command. The only processing make does on\\nthe result is to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a single space. If\\nthere is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it will simply be removed.\\n\\nThe commands run by calls to the shell function are run when the function calls are\\nexpanded (see Section 3.7 [How make Reads a Makefile], page 17). Because this function\\ninvolves spawning a new shell, you should carefully consider the performance implications\\nof using the shell function within recursively expanded variables vs. simply expanded\\nvariables (see Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66).\\n\\nAn alternative to the shell function is the ‘!=’ assignment operator; it provides a similar\\nbehavior but has subtle differences (see Section 6.5 [Setting Variables], page 72). The ‘!=’\\nassignment operator is included in newer POSIX standards.\\n\\nAfter the shell function or ‘!=’ assignment operator is used, its exit status is placed in\\n\\nthe .SHELLSTATUS variable.\\n\\nHere are some examples of the use of the shell function:\\n\\ncontents := $(shell cat foo)\\n\\nsets contents to the contents of the file foo, with a space (rather than a newline) separating\\neach line.\\n\\nfiles := $(shell echo *.c)\\n\\nsets files to the expansion of ‘*.c’. Unless make is using a very strange shell, this has the\\nsame result as ‘$(wildcard *.c)’ (as long as at least one ‘.c’ file exists).\\n\\nAll variables that are marked as export will also be passed to the shell started by the\\nshell function. It is possible to create a variable expansion loop: consider this makefile:\\n\\nexport HI = $(shell echo hi)\\nall: ; @echo $$HI\\n\\nWhen make wants to run the recipe it must add the variable HI to the environment; to\\ndo so it must be expanded. The value of this variable requires an invocation of the shell\\nfunction, and to invoke it we must create its environment. Since HI is exported, we need to\\nexpand it to create its environment. And so on. In this obscure case make will use the value\\nof the variable from the environment provided to make, or else the empty string if there was\\nnone, rather than looping or issuing an error. This is often what you want; for example:\\n\\nexport PATH = $(shell echo /usr/local/bin:$$PATH)\\n\\nHowever, it would be simpler and more efficient to use a simply-expanded variable here\\n\\n(‘:=’) in the first place.\\n\\n\\x0c108\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n8.15 The guile Function\\nIf GNU make is built with support for GNU Guile as an embedded extension language then\\nthe guile function will be available. The guile function takes one argument which is first\\nexpanded by make in the normal fashion, then passed to the GNU Guile evaluator. The\\nresult of the evaluator is converted into a string and used as the expansion of the guile\\nfunction in the makefile. See Section 12.1 [GNU Guile Integration], page 143, for details on\\nwriting extensions to make in Guile.\\n\\nYou can determine whether GNU Guile support is available by checking the .FEATURES\\n\\nvariable for the word guile.\\n\\n\\x0c109\\n\\n9 How to Run make\\n\\nA makefile that says how to recompile a program can be used in more than one way. The\\nsimplest use is to recompile every file that is out of date. Usually, makefiles are written so\\nthat if you run make with no arguments, it does just that.\\n\\nBut you might want to update only some of the files; you might want to use a different\\ncompiler or different compiler options; you might want just to find out which files are out\\nof date without changing them.\\n\\nBy giving arguments when you run make, you can do any of these things and many\\n\\nothers.\\n\\n0\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe exit status of make is always one of three values:\\n\\nThe exit status is zero if make is successful.\\n\\nThe exit status is two if make encounters any errors.\\ndescribing the particular errors.\\n\\nIt will print messages\\n\\nThe exit status is one if you use the ‘-q’ flag and make determines that some\\ntarget is not already up to date. See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes],\\npage 111.\\n\\n9.1 Arguments to Specify the Makefile\\n\\nThe way to specify the name of the makefile is with the ‘-f’ or ‘--file’ option (‘--makefile’\\nalso works). For example, ‘-f altmake’ says to use the file altmake as the makefile.\\n\\nIf you use the ‘-f’ flag several times and follow each ‘-f’ with an argument, all the\\n\\nspecified files are used jointly as makefiles.\\n\\nIf you do not use the ‘-f’ or ‘--file’ flag, the default is to try GNUmakefile, makefile,\\nand Makefile, in that order, and use the first of these three which exists or can be made\\n(see Chapter 3 [Writing Makefiles], page 11).\\n\\n9.2 Arguments to Specify the Goals\\n\\nThe goals are the targets that make should strive ultimately to update. Other targets are\\nupdated as well if they appear as prerequisites of goals, or prerequisites of prerequisites of\\ngoals, etc.\\n\\nBy default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting targets that start with\\na period). Therefore, makefiles are usually written so that the first target is for compiling\\nthe entire program or programs they describe. If the first rule in the makefile has several\\ntargets, only the first target in the rule becomes the default goal, not the whole list. You can\\nmanage the selection of the default goal from within your makefile using the .DEFAULT_GOAL\\nvariable (see Section 6.14 [Other Special Variables], page 80).\\n\\nYou can also specify a different goal or goals with command line arguments to make.\\nUse the name of the goal as an argument. If you specify several goals, make processes each\\nof them in turn, in the order you name them.\\n\\nAny target in the makefile may be specified as a goal (unless it starts with ‘-’ or contains\\nan ‘=’, in which case it will be parsed as a switch or variable definition, respectively). Even\\n\\n\\x0c110\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ntargets not in the makefile may be specified, if make can find implicit rules that say how to\\nmake them.\\n\\nMake will set the special variable MAKECMDGOALS to the list of goals you specified on the\\ncommand line. If no goals were given on the command line, this variable is empty. Note\\nthat this variable should be used only in special circumstances.\\n\\nAn example of appropriate use is to avoid including .d files during clean rules (see\\nSection 4.13 [Automatic Prerequisites], page 42), so make won’t create them only to imme-\\ndiately remove them again:\\n\\nsources = foo.c bar.c\\n\\nifeq (,$(filter clean,$(MAKECMDGOALS))\\ninclude $(sources:.c=.d)\\nendif\\n\\nOne use of specifying a goal is if you want to compile only a part of the program, or only\\none of several programs. Specify as a goal each file that you wish to remake. For example,\\nconsider a directory containing several programs, with a makefile that starts like this:\\n\\n.PHONY: all\\nall: size nm ld ar as\\n\\nIf you are working on the program size, you might want to say ‘make size’ so that only\\n\\nthe files of that program are recompiled.\\n\\nAnother use of specifying a goal is to make files that are not normally made. For\\nexample, there may be a file of debugging output, or a version of the program that is\\ncompiled specially for testing, which has a rule in the makefile but is not a prerequisite of\\nthe default goal.\\n\\nAnother use of specifying a goal is to run the recipe associated with a phony target\\n(see Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31) or empty target (see Section 4.7 [Empty Target\\nFiles to Record Events], page 34). Many makefiles contain a phony target named clean\\nwhich deletes everything except source files. Naturally, this is done only if you request it\\nexplicitly with ‘make clean’. Following is a list of typical phony and empty target names.\\nSee Section 16.6 [Standard Targets], page 171, for a detailed list of all the standard target\\nnames which GNU software packages use.\\n\\nall\\n\\nclean\\n\\nMake all the top-level targets the makefile knows about.\\n\\nDelete all files that are normally created by running make.\\n\\nmostlyclean\\n\\nLike ‘clean’, but may refrain from deleting a few files that people normally\\ndon’t want to recompile. For example, the ‘mostlyclean’ target for GCC does\\nnot delete libgcc.a, because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot\\nof time.\\n\\ndistclean\\nrealclean\\nclobber\\n\\nAny of these targets might be defined to delete more files than ‘clean’ does. For\\nexample, this would delete configuration files or links that you would normally\\ncreate as preparation for compilation, even if the makefile itself cannot create\\nthese files.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9: How to Run make\\n\\n111\\n\\ninstall\\n\\nCopy the executable file into a directory that users typically search for com-\\nmands; copy any auxiliary files that the executable uses into the directories\\nwhere it will look for them.\\n\\nprint\\n\\nPrint listings of the source files that have changed.\\n\\ntar\\n\\nshar\\n\\ndist\\n\\nTAGS\\n\\ncheck\\ntest\\n\\nCreate a tar file of the source files.\\n\\nCreate a shell archive (shar file) of the source files.\\n\\nCreate a distribution file of the source files. This might be a tar file, or a shar\\nfile, or a compressed version of one of the above, or even more than one of the\\nabove.\\n\\nUpdate a tags table for this program.\\n\\nPerform self tests on the program this makefile builds.\\n\\n9.3 Instead of Executing Recipes\\n\\nThe makefile tells make how to tell whether a target is up to date, and how to update each\\ntarget. But updating the targets is not always what you want. Certain options specify\\nother activities for make.\\n\\n‘-n’\\n‘--just-print’\\n‘--dry-run’\\n‘--recon’\\n\\n“No-op”. Causes make to print the recipes that are needed to make the targets\\nup to date, but not actually execute them. Note that some recipes are still\\nexecuted, even with this flag (see Section 5.7.1 [How the MAKE Variable Works],\\npage 56). Also any recipes needed to update included makefiles are still executed\\n(see Section 3.5 [How Makefiles Are Remade], page 15).\\n\\n‘-t’\\n‘--touch’\\n\\n“Touch”. Marks targets as up to date without actually changing them.\\nIn\\nother words, make pretends to update the targets but does not really change\\ntheir contents; instead only their modified times are updated.\\n\\n‘-q’\\n‘--question’\\n\\n“Question”. Silently check whether the targets are up to date, but do not\\nexecute recipes; the exit code shows whether any updates are needed.\\n\\n‘-W file’\\n‘--what-if=file’\\n‘--assume-new=file’\\n‘--new-file=file’\\n\\n“What if”. Each ‘-W’ flag is followed by a file name. The given files’ modification\\ntimes are recorded by make as being the present time, although the actual\\n\\n\\x0c112\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nmodification times remain the same. You can use the ‘-W’ flag in conjunction\\nwith the ‘-n’ flag to see what would happen if you were to modify specific files.\\n\\nWith the ‘-n’ flag, make prints the recipe that it would normally execute but usually\\n\\ndoes not execute it.\\n\\nWith the ‘-t’ flag, make ignores the recipes in the rules and uses (in effect) the command\\ntouch for each target that needs to be remade. The touch command is also printed, unless\\n‘-s’ or .SILENT is used. For speed, make does not actually invoke the program touch. It\\ndoes the work directly.\\n\\nWith the ‘-q’ flag, make prints nothing and executes no recipes, but the exit status code\\nit returns is zero if and only if the targets to be considered are already up to date. If the\\nexit status is one, then some updating needs to be done. If make encounters an error, the\\nexit status is two, so you can distinguish an error from a target that is not up to date.\\n\\nIt is an error to use more than one of these three flags in the same invocation of make.\\nThe ‘-n’, ‘-t’, and ‘-q’ options do not affect recipe lines that begin with ‘+’ characters\\nor contain the strings ‘$(MAKE)’ or ‘${MAKE}’. Note that only the line containing the ‘+’\\ncharacter or the strings ‘$(MAKE)’ or ‘${MAKE}’ is run regardless of these options. Other\\nlines in the same rule are not run unless they too begin with ‘+’ or contain ‘$(MAKE)’ or\\n‘${MAKE}’ (See Section 5.7.1 [How the MAKE Variable Works], page 56.)\\n\\nThe ‘-t’ flag prevents phony targets (see Section 4.5 [Phony Targets], page 31) from\\nbeing updated, unless there are recipe lines beginning with ‘+’ or containing ‘$(MAKE)’ or\\n‘${MAKE}’.\\n\\nThe ‘-W’ flag provides two features:\\n\\n• If you also use the ‘-n’ or ‘-q’ flag, you can see what make would do if you were to\\n\\nmodify some files.\\n\\n• Without the ‘-n’ or ‘-q’ flag, when make is actually executing recipes, the ‘-W’ flag\\ncan direct make to act as if some files had been modified, without actually running the\\nrecipes for those files.\\n\\nNote that the options ‘-p’ and ‘-v’ allow you to obtain other information about make or\\n\\nabout the makefiles in use (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114).\\n\\n9.4 Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files\\n\\nSometimes you may have changed a source file but you do not want to recompile all the\\nfiles that depend on it. For example, suppose you add a macro or a declaration to a header\\nfile that many other files depend on. Being conservative, make assumes that any change\\nin the header file requires recompilation of all dependent files, but you know that they do\\nnot need to be recompiled and you would rather not waste the time waiting for them to\\ncompile.\\n\\nIf you anticipate the problem before changing the header file, you can use the ‘-t’ flag.\\nThis flag tells make not to run the recipes in the rules, but rather to mark the target up to\\ndate by changing its last-modification date. You would follow this procedure:\\n\\n1. Use the command ‘make’ to recompile the source files that really need recompilation,\\n\\nensuring that the object files are up-to-date before you begin.\\n\\n2. Make the changes in the header files.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9: How to Run make\\n\\n113\\n\\n3. Use the command ‘make -t’ to mark all the object files as up to date. The next time\\n\\nyou run make, the changes in the header files will not cause any recompilation.\\n\\nIf you have already changed the header file at a time when some files do need recom-\\npilation, it is too late to do this. Instead, you can use the ‘-o file’ flag, which marks a\\nspecified file as “old” (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114). This means that\\nthe file itself will not be remade, and nothing else will be remade on its account. Follow\\nthis procedure:\\n\\n1. Recompile the source files that need compilation for reasons independent of the partic-\\nular header file, with ‘make -o headerfile’. If several header files are involved, use a\\nseparate ‘-o’ option for each header file.\\n2. Touch all the object files with ‘make -t’.\\n\\n9.5 Overriding Variables\\n\\nAn argument that contains ‘=’ specifies the value of a variable: ‘v=x’ sets the value of the\\nvariable v to x. If you specify a value in this way, all ordinary assignments of the same\\nvariable in the makefile are ignored; we say they have been overridden by the command line\\nargument.\\n\\nThe most common way to use this facility is to pass extra flags to compilers. For example,\\nin a properly written makefile, the variable CFLAGS is included in each recipe that runs the\\nC compiler, so a file foo.c would be compiled something like this:\\n\\ncc -c $(CFLAGS) foo.c\\n\\nThus, whatever value you set for CFLAGS affects each compilation that occurs. The\\n\\nmakefile probably specifies the usual value for CFLAGS, like this:\\n\\nCFLAGS=-g\\n\\nEach time you run make, you can override this value if you wish. For example, if you\\nsay ‘make CFLAGS=’-g -O’’, each C compilation will be done with ‘cc -c -g -O’. (This also\\nillustrates how you can use quoting in the shell to enclose spaces and other special characters\\nin the value of a variable when you override it.)\\n\\nThe variable CFLAGS is only one of many standard variables that exist just so that you\\ncan change them this way. See Section 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125,\\nfor a complete list.\\n\\nYou can also program the makefile to look at additional variables of your own, giving\\nthe user the ability to control other aspects of how the makefile works by changing the\\nvariables.\\n\\nWhen you override a variable with a command line argument, you can define either a\\nrecursively-expanded variable or a simply-expanded variable. The examples shown above\\nmake a recursively-expanded variable; to make a simply-expanded variable, write ‘:=’ or\\n‘::=’ instead of ‘=’. But, unless you want to include a variable reference or function call in\\nthe value that you specify, it makes no difference which kind of variable you create.\\n\\nThere is one way that the makefile can change a variable that you have overridden. This\\nis to use the override directive, which is a line that looks like this: ‘override variable =\\nvalue’ (see Section 6.7 [The override Directive], page 75).\\n\\n\\x0c114\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n9.6 Testing the Compilation of a Program\\n\\nNormally, when an error happens in executing a shell command, make gives up immediately,\\nreturning a nonzero status. No further recipes are executed for any target. The error implies\\nthat the goal cannot be correctly remade, and make reports this as soon as it knows.\\n\\nWhen you are compiling a program that you have just changed, this is not what you\\nwant. Instead, you would rather that make try compiling every file that can be tried, to\\nshow you as many compilation errors as possible.\\n\\nOn these occasions, you should use the ‘-k’ or ‘--keep-going’ flag. This tells make\\nto continue to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if\\nnecessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status. For example, after an error in\\ncompiling one object file, ‘make -k’ will continue compiling other object files even though it\\nalready knows that linking them will be impossible. In addition to continuing after failed\\nshell commands, ‘make -k’ will continue as much as possible after discovering that it does\\nnot know how to make a target or prerequisite file. This will always cause an error message,\\nbut without ‘-k’, it is a fatal error (see Section 9.8 [Summary of Options], page 114).\\n\\nThe usual behavior of make assumes that your purpose is to get the goals up to date;\\nonce make learns that this is impossible, it might as well report the failure immediately.\\nThe ‘-k’ flag says that the real purpose is to test as much as possible of the changes made\\nin the program, perhaps to find several independent problems so that you can correct them\\nall before the next attempt to compile. This is why Emacs’ M-x compile command passes\\nthe ‘-k’ flag by default.\\n\\n9.7 Temporary Files\\n\\nIn some situations, make will need to create its own temporary files. These files must not\\nbe disturbed while make is running, including all recursively-invoked instances of make.\\n\\nIf the environment variable MAKE_TMPDIR is set then all temporary files created by make\\n\\nwill be placed there.\\n\\nIf MAKE_TMPDIR is not set, then the standard location for temporary files for the current\\noperating system will be used. For POSIX systems this will be the location set in the\\nTMPDIR environment variable, or else the system’s default location (e.g., /tmp) is used. On\\nWindows, first TMP then TEMP will be checked, then TMPDIR, and finally the system default\\ntemporary file location will be used.\\n\\nNote that this directory must already exist or make will fail: make will not attempt to\\n\\ncreate it.\\n\\nThese variables cannot be set from within a makefile: GNU make must have access to\\n\\nthis location before it begins reading the makefiles.\\n\\n9.8 Summary of Options\\n\\nHere is a table of all the options make understands:\\n\\n‘-b’\\n‘-m’\\n\\nThese options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of make.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9: How to Run make\\n\\n115\\n\\n‘-B’\\n‘--always-make’\\n\\nConsider all targets out-of-date. GNU make proceeds to consider targets and\\ntheir prerequisites using the normal algorithms; however, all targets so consid-\\nered are always remade regardless of the status of their prerequisites. To avoid\\ninfinite recursion, if MAKE_RESTARTS (see Section 6.14 [Other Special Variables],\\npage 80) is set to a number greater than 0 this option is disabled when consider-\\ning whether to remake makefiles (see Section 3.5 [How Makefiles Are Remade],\\npage 15).\\n\\n‘-C dir’\\n‘--directory=dir’\\n\\n‘-d’\\n\\nChange to directory dir before reading the makefiles. If multiple ‘-C’ options\\nare specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: ‘-C / -C etc’ is\\nequivalent to ‘-C /etc’. This is typically used with recursive invocations of\\nmake (see Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56).\\n\\nPrint debugging information in addition to normal processing. The debugging\\ninformation says which files are being considered for remaking, which file-times\\nare being compared and with what results, which files actually need to be\\nremade, which implicit rules are considered and which are applied—everything\\ninteresting about how make decides what to do. The -d option is equivalent to\\n‘--debug=a’ (see below).\\n\\n‘--debug[=options]’\\n\\nPrint debugging information in addition to normal processing. Various levels\\nand types of output can be chosen. With no arguments, print the “basic”\\nlevel of debugging. Possible arguments are below; only the first character is\\nconsidered, and values must be comma- or space-separated.\\n\\na (all)\\n\\nAll types of debugging output are enabled. This is equivalent to\\nusing ‘-d’.\\n\\nb (basic) Basic debugging prints each target that was found to be out-of-date,\\n\\nand whether the build was successful or not.\\n\\nv (verbose)\\n\\nA level above ‘basic’;\\nincludes messages about which makefiles\\nwere parsed, prerequisites that did not need to be rebuilt, etc. This\\noption also enables ‘basic’ messages.\\n\\ni (implicit)\\n\\nPrints messages describing the implicit rule searches for each target.\\nThis option also enables ‘basic’ messages.\\n\\nj (jobs) Prints messages giving details on the invocation of specific sub-\\n\\ncommands.\\n\\nm (makefile)\\n\\nBy default, the above messages are not enabled while trying to re-\\nmake the makefiles. This option enables messages while rebuilding\\n\\n\\x0c116\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nmakefiles, too. Note that the ‘all’ option does enable this option.\\nThis option also enables ‘basic’ messages.\\n\\np (print) Prints the recipe to be executed, even when the recipe is normally\\nsilent (due to .SILENT or ‘@’). Also prints the makefile name and\\nline number where the recipe was defined.\\n\\nw (why)\\n\\nExplains why each target must be remade by showing which pre-\\nrequisites are more up to date than the target.\\n\\nn (none) Disable all debugging currently enabled. If additional debugging\\nflags are encountered after this they will still take effect.\\n\\n‘-e’\\n‘--environment-overrides’\\n\\nGive variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from make-\\nfiles. See Section 6.10 [Variables from the Environment], page 77.\\n\\n‘-E string’\\n‘--eval=string’\\n\\nEvaluate string as makefile syntax. This is a command-line version of the\\neval function (see Section 8.10 [Eval Function], page 103). The evaluation is\\nperformed after the default rules and variables have been defined, but before\\nany makefiles are read.\\n\\n‘-f file’\\n‘--file=file’\\n‘--makefile=file’\\n\\nRead the file named file as a makefile. See Chapter 3 [Writing Makefiles],\\npage 11.\\n\\n‘-h’\\n‘--help’\\n\\nRemind you of the options that make understands and then exit.\\n\\n‘-i’\\n‘--ignore-errors’\\n\\nIgnore all errors in recipes executed to remake files. See Section 5.5 [Errors in\\nRecipes], page 54.\\n\\n‘-I dir’\\n‘--include-dir=dir’\\n\\nSpecifies a directory dir to search for included makefiles. See Section 3.3 [In-\\ncluding Other Makefiles], page 13. If several ‘-I’ options are used to specify\\nseveral directories, the directories are searched in the order specified.\\nIf the\\ndirectory dir is a single dash (-) then any already-specified directories up to\\nthat point (including the default directory paths) will be discarded. You can\\nexamine the current list of directories to be searched via the .INCLUDE_DIRS\\nvariable.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9: How to Run make\\n\\n117\\n\\n‘-j [jobs]’\\n‘--jobs[=jobs]’\\n\\nSpecifies the number of recipes (jobs) to run simultaneously. With no argument,\\nmake runs as many recipes simultaneously as possible. If there is more than\\none ‘-j’ option, the last one is effective. See Section 5.4 [Parallel Execution],\\npage 51, for more information on how recipes are run. Note that this option is\\nignored on MS-DOS.\\n\\n‘--jobserver-style=[style]’\\n\\nChooses the style of jobserver to use. This option only has effect if parallel\\nbuilds are enabled (see Section 5.4 [Parallel Execution], page 51). On POSIX\\nsystems style can be one of fifo (the default) or pipe. On Windows the only\\nacceptable style is sem (the default). This option is useful if you need to use an\\nolder versions of GNU make, or a different tool that requires a specific jobserver\\nstyle.\\n\\n‘-k’\\n‘--keep-going’\\n\\nContinue as much as possible after an error. While the target that failed, and\\nthose that depend on it, cannot be remade, the other prerequisites of these\\ntargets can be processed all the same. See Section 9.6 [Testing the Compilation\\nof a Program], page 114.\\n\\n‘-l [load]’\\n‘--load-average[=load]’\\n‘--max-load[=load]’\\n\\nSpecifies that no new recipes should be started if there are other recipes run-\\nning and the load average is at least load (a floating-point number). With no\\nargument, removes a previous load limit. See Section 5.4 [Parallel Execution],\\npage 51.\\n\\n‘-L’\\n‘--check-symlink-times’\\n\\nOn systems that support symbolic links, this option causes make to consider\\nthe timestamps on any symbolic links in addition to the timestamp on the\\nfile referenced by those links. When this option is provided, the most recent\\ntimestamp among the file and the symbolic links is taken as the modification\\ntime for this target file.\\n\\n‘-n’\\n‘--just-print’\\n‘--dry-run’\\n‘--recon’\\n\\nPrint the recipe that would be executed, but do not execute it (except in certain\\ncircumstances). See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes], page 111.\\n\\n‘-o file’\\n‘--old-file=file’\\n‘--assume-old=file’\\n\\nDo not remake the file file even if it is older than its prerequisites, and do not\\nremake anything on account of changes in file. Essentially the file is treated as\\n\\n\\x0c118\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nvery old and its rules are ignored. See Section 9.4 [Avoiding Recompilation of\\nSome Files], page 112.\\n\\n‘-O[type]’\\n‘--output-sync[=type]’\\n\\nEnsure that the complete output from each recipe is printed in one uninter-\\nrupted sequence. This option is only useful when using the --jobs option\\nto run multiple recipes simultaneously (see Section 5.4 [Parallel Execution],\\npage 51) Without this option output will be displayed as it is generated by the\\nrecipes.\\nWith no type or the type ‘target’, output from the entire recipe of each target\\nis grouped together. With the type ‘line’, output from each line in the recipe is\\ngrouped together. With the type ‘recurse’, the output from an entire recursive\\nmake is grouped together. With the type ‘none’, no output synchronization is\\nperformed. See Section 5.4.2 [Output During Parallel Execution], page 53.\\n\\n‘-p’\\n‘--print-data-base’\\n\\nPrint the data base (rules and variable values) that results from reading the\\nmakefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also prints the\\nversion information given by the ‘-v’ switch (see below). To print the data\\nbase without trying to remake any files, use ‘make -qp’. To print the data base\\nof predefined rules and variables, use ‘make -p -f /dev/null’. The data base\\noutput contains file name and line number information for recipe and variable\\ndefinitions, so it can be a useful debugging tool in complex environments.\\n\\n‘-q’\\n‘--question’\\n\\n“Question mode”. Do not run any recipes, or print anything; just return an\\nexit status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, one if any\\nremaking is required, or two if an error is encountered. See Section 9.3 [Instead\\nof Executing Recipes], page 111.\\n\\n‘-r’\\n‘--no-builtin-rules’\\n\\nEliminate use of the built-in implicit rules (see Chapter 10 [Using Implicit\\nRules], page 121). You can still define your own by writing pattern rules (see\\nSection 10.5 [Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules], page 129). The ‘-r’\\noption also clears out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules (see Section 10.7\\n[Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules], page 136). But you can still define your own\\nsuffixes with a rule for .SUFFIXES, and then define your own suffix rules. Note\\nthat only rules are affected by the -r option; default variables remain in effect\\n(see Section 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125); see the ‘-R’\\noption below.\\n\\n‘-R’\\n‘--no-builtin-variables’\\n\\nEliminate use of the built-in rule-specific variables (see Section 10.3 [Variables\\nUsed by Implicit Rules], page 125). You can still define your own, of course.\\nThe ‘-R’ option also automatically enables the ‘-r’ option (see above), since\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 9: How to Run make\\n\\n119\\n\\nit doesn’t make sense to have implicit rules without any definitions for the\\nvariables that they use.\\n\\n‘-s’\\n‘--silent’\\n‘--quiet’\\n\\nSilent operation; do not print the recipes as they are executed. See Section 5.2\\n[Recipe Echoing], page 47.\\n\\n‘-S’\\n‘--no-keep-going’\\n‘--stop’\\n\\nCancel the effect of the ‘-k’ option. This is never necessary except in a recursive\\nmake where ‘-k’ might be inherited from the top-level make via MAKEFLAGS (see\\nSection 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56) or if you set ‘-k’ in MAKEFLAGS in\\nyour environment.\\n\\n‘--shuffle[=mode]’\\n\\nThis option enables a form of fuzz-testing of prerequisite relationships. When\\nparallelism is enabled (‘-j’) the order in which targets are built becomes less\\ndeterministic. If prerequisites are not fully declared in the makefile this can\\nlead to intermittent and hard-to-track-down build failures.\\nThe ‘--shuffle’ option forces make to purposefully reorder goals and prerequi-\\nsites so target/prerequisite relationships still hold, but ordering of prerequisites\\nof a given target are reordered as described below.\\nThe order in which prerequisites are listed in automatic variables is not changed\\nby this option.\\nThe .NOTPARALLEL pseudo-target disables shuffling for that makefile. Also any\\nprerequisite list which contains .WAIT will not be shuffled. See Section 5.4.1\\n[Disabling Parallel Execution], page 51.\\nThe ‘--shuffle=’ option accepts these values:\\n\\nrandom\\n\\nChoose a random seed for the shuffle. This is the default if no\\nmode is specified. The chosen seed is also provided to sub-make\\ncommands. The seed is included in error messages so that it can\\nbe re-used in future runs to reproduce the problem or verify that\\nit has been resolved.\\n\\nreverse\\n\\nReverse the order of goals and prerequisites, rather than a random\\nshuffle.\\n\\nseed\\n\\nUse ‘random’ shuffle initialized with the specified seed value. The\\nseed is an integer.\\n\\nnone\\n\\nDisable shuffling. This negates any previous ‘--shuffle’ options.\\n\\n‘-t’\\n‘--touch’\\n\\nTouch files (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of\\nrunning their recipes. This is used to pretend that the recipes were done, in\\n\\n\\x0c120\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\norder to fool future invocations of make. See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing\\nRecipes], page 111.\\n\\n‘--trace’ Show tracing information for make execution. Using --trace is shorthand for\\n\\n--debug=print,why.\\n\\n‘-v’\\n‘--version’\\n\\nPrint the version of the make program plus a copyright, a list of authors, and a\\nnotice that there is no warranty; then exit.\\n\\n‘-w’\\n‘--print-directory’\\n\\nPrint a message containing the working directory both before and after execut-\\ning the makefile. This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated\\nnests of recursive make commands. See Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make],\\npage 56. (In practice, you rarely need to specify this option since ‘make’ does\\nit for you; see Section 5.7.4 [The ‘--print-directory’ Option], page 61.)\\n\\n‘--no-print-directory’\\n\\nDisable printing of the working directory under -w. This option is useful when\\n-w is turned on automatically, but you do not want to see the extra messages.\\nSee Section 5.7.4 [The ‘--print-directory’ Option], page 61.\\n\\n‘-W file’\\n‘--what-if=file’\\n‘--new-file=file’\\n‘--assume-new=file’\\n\\nPretend that the target file has just been modified. When used with the ‘-n’\\nflag, this shows you what would happen if you were to modify that file. Without\\n‘-n’, it is almost the same as running a touch command on the given file\\nbefore running make, except that the modification time is changed only in the\\nimagination of make. See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes], page 111.\\n\\n‘--warn-undefined-variables’\\n\\nIssue a warning message whenever make sees a reference to an undefined vari-\\nable. This can be helpful when you are trying to debug makefiles which use\\nvariables in complex ways.\\n\\n\\x0c121\\n\\n10 Using Implicit Rules\\n\\nCertain standard ways of remaking target files are used very often. For example, one\\ncustomary way to make an object file is from a C source file using the C compiler, cc.\\n\\nImplicit rules tell make how to use customary techniques so that you do not have to\\nspecify them in detail when you want to use them. For example, there is an implicit rule\\nfor C compilation. File names determine which implicit rules are run. For example, C\\ncompilation typically takes a .c file and makes a .o file. So make applies the implicit rule\\nfor C compilation when it sees this combination of file name endings.\\n\\nA chain of implicit rules can apply in sequence; for example, make will remake a .o file\\n\\nfrom a .y file by way of a .c file. See Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\nThe built-in implicit rules use several variables in their recipes so that, by changing\\nthe values of the variables, you can change the way the implicit rule works. For example,\\nthe variable CFLAGS controls the flags given to the C compiler by the implicit rule for C\\ncompilation. See Section 10.3 [Variables Used by Implicit Rules], page 125.\\n\\nYou can define your own implicit rules by writing pattern rules. See Section 10.5 [Defining\\n\\nand Redefining Pattern Rules], page 129.\\n\\nSuffix rules are a more limited way to define implicit rules. Pattern rules are more general\\nand clearer, but suffix rules are retained for compatibility. See Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned\\nSuffix Rules], page 136.\\n\\n10.1 Using Implicit Rules\\n\\nTo allow make to find a customary method for updating a target file, all you have to do is\\nrefrain from specifying recipes yourself. Either write a rule with no recipe, or don’t write\\na rule at all. Then make will figure out which implicit rule to use based on which kind of\\nsource file exists or can be made.\\n\\nFor example, suppose the makefile looks like this:\\n\\nfoo : foo.o bar.o\\n\\ncc -o foo foo.o bar.o $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)\\n\\nBecause you mention foo.o but do not give a rule for it, make will automatically look for\\nan implicit rule that tells how to update it. This happens whether or not the file foo.o\\ncurrently exists.\\n\\nIf an implicit rule is found, it can supply both a recipe and one or more prerequisites\\n(the source files). You would want to write a rule for foo.o with no recipe if you need to\\nspecify additional prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot supply.\\n\\nEach implicit rule has a target pattern and prerequisite patterns. There may be many\\nimplicit rules with the same target pattern. For example, numerous rules make ‘.o’ files:\\none, from a ‘.c’ file with the C compiler; another, from a ‘.p’ file with the Pascal compiler;\\nand so on. The rule that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites exist or can be\\nmade. So, if you have a file foo.c, make will run the C compiler; otherwise, if you have a\\nfile foo.p, make will run the Pascal compiler; and so on.\\n\\nOf course, when you write the makefile, you know which implicit rule you want make\\nto use, and you know it will choose that one because you know which possible prerequisite\\n\\n\\x0c122\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nfiles are supposed to exist. See Section 10.2 [Catalogue of Built-In Rules], page 122, for a\\ncatalogue of all the predefined implicit rules.\\n\\nAbove, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites “exist or can be\\nmade”. A file “can be made” if it is mentioned explicitly in the makefile as a target or a\\nprerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be recursively found for how to make it. When an\\nimplicit prerequisite is the result of another implicit rule, we say that chaining is occurring.\\nSee Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\nIn general, make searches for an implicit rule for each target, and for each double-colon\\nrule, that has no recipe. A file that is mentioned only as a prerequisite is considered a\\ntarget whose rule specifies nothing, so implicit rule search happens for it. See Section 10.8\\n[Implicit Rule Search Algorithm], page 137, for the details of how the search is done.\\n\\nNote that explicit prerequisites do not influence implicit rule search. For example, con-\\n\\nsider this explicit rule:\\n\\nfoo.o: foo.p\\n\\nThe prerequisite on foo.p does not necessarily mean that make will remake foo.o according\\nto the implicit rule to make an object file, a .o file, from a Pascal source file, a .p file. For\\nexample, if foo.c also exists, the implicit rule to make an object file from a C source file\\nis used instead, because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined implicit\\nrules (see Section 10.2 [Catalogue of Built-In Rules], page 122).\\n\\nIf you do not want an implicit rule to be used for a target that has no recipe, you can\\ngive that target an empty recipe by writing a semicolon (see Section 5.9 [Defining Empty\\nRecipes], page 62).\\n\\n10.2 Catalogue of Built-In Rules\\n\\nHere is a catalogue of predefined implicit rules which are always available unless the\\nSee Section 10.5.6 [Canceling Implicit\\nmakefile explicitly overrides or cancels them.\\nRules], page 135, for information on canceling or overriding an implicit rule. The ‘-r’ or\\n‘--no-builtin-rules’ option cancels all predefined rules.\\n\\nThis manual only documents the default rules available on POSIX-based operating sys-\\ntems. Other operating systems, such as VMS, Windows, OS/2, etc. may have different sets\\nof default rules. To see the full list of default rules and variables available in your version\\nof GNU make, run ‘make -p’ in a directory with no makefile.\\n\\nNot all of these rules will always be defined, even when the ‘-r’ option is not given.\\nMany of the predefined implicit rules are implemented in make as suffix rules, so which\\nones will be defined depends on the suffix list (the list of prerequisites of the special target\\n.SUFFIXES). The default suffix list is: .out, .a, .ln, .o, .c, .cc, .C, .cpp, .p, .f, .F, .m,\\n.r, .y, .l, .ym, .lm, .s, .S, .mod, .sym, .def, .h, .info, .dvi, .tex, .texinfo, .texi,\\n.txinfo, .w, .ch .web, .sh, .elc, .el. All of the implicit rules described below whose\\nprerequisites have one of these suffixes are actually suffix rules. If you modify the suffix list,\\nthe only predefined suffix rules in effect will be those named by one or two of the suffixes\\nthat are on the list you specify; rules whose suffixes fail to be on the list are disabled. See\\nSection 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules], page 136, for full details on suffix rules.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n123\\n\\nCompiling C programs\\n\\nn.o is made automatically from n.c with a recipe of\\n‘$(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c’.\\n\\nthe\\n\\nform\\n\\nCompiling C++ programs\\n\\nn.o is made automatically from n.cc, n.cpp, or n.C with a recipe of the form\\n‘$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c’. We encourage you to use the suffix\\n‘.cc’ or ‘.cpp’ for C++ source files instead of ‘.C’ to better support case-\\ninsensitive file systems.\\n\\nCompiling Pascal programs\\n\\nn.o is made automatically from n.p with the recipe ‘$(PC) $(PFLAGS) -c’.\\n\\nCompiling Fortran and Ratfor programs\\n\\nn.o is made automatically from n.r, n.F or n.f by running the Fortran com-\\npiler. The precise recipe used is as follows:\\n\\n‘.f’\\n\\n‘.F’\\n\\n‘.r’\\n\\n‘$(FC) $(FFLAGS) -c’.\\n\\n‘$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c’.\\n\\n‘$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(RFLAGS) -c’.\\n\\nPreprocessing Fortran and Ratfor programs\\n\\nn.f is made automatically from n.r or n.F. This rule runs just the preprocessor\\nto convert a Ratfor or preprocessable Fortran program into a strict Fortran\\nprogram. The precise recipe used is as follows:\\n\\n‘.F’\\n\\n‘.r’\\n\\n‘$(FC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(FFLAGS) -F’.\\n\\n‘$(FC) $(FFLAGS) $(RFLAGS) -F’.\\n\\nCompiling Modula-2 programs\\n\\nn.sym is made from n.def with a recipe of the form ‘$(M2C) $(M2FLAGS) $(DEFFLAGS)’.\\nn.o is made from n.mod; the form is: ‘$(M2C) $(M2FLAGS) $(MODFLAGS)’.\\n\\nAssembling and preprocessing assembler programs\\n\\nn.o is made automatically from n.s by running the assembler, as. The precise\\nrecipe is ‘$(AS) $(ASFLAGS)’.\\n\\nn.s is made automatically from n.S by running the C preprocessor, cpp. The\\nprecise recipe is ‘$(CPP) $(CPPFLAGS)’.\\n\\nLinking a single object file\\n\\nn is made automatically from n.o by running the C compiler to link the pro-\\ngram. The precise recipe used is ‘$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)’.\\n\\nThis rule does the right thing for a simple program with only one source file. It\\nwill also do the right thing if there are multiple object files (presumably coming\\nfrom various other source files), one of which has a name matching that of the\\nexecutable file. Thus,\\n\\nx: y.o z.o\\n\\nwhen x.c, y.c and z.c all exist will execute:\\n\\n\\x0c124\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ncc -c x.c -o x.o\\ncc -c y.c -o y.o\\ncc -c z.c -o z.o\\ncc x.o y.o z.o -o x\\nrm -f x.o\\nrm -f y.o\\nrm -f z.o\\n\\nIn more complicated cases, such as when there is no object file whose name\\nderives from the executable file name, you must write an explicit recipe for\\nlinking.\\n\\nEach kind of file automatically made into ‘.o’ object files will be automatically\\nlinked by using the compiler (‘$(CC)’, ‘$(FC)’ or ‘$(PC)’; the C compiler ‘$(CC)’\\nis used to assemble ‘.s’ files) without the ‘-c’ option. This could be done by\\nusing the ‘.o’ object files as intermediates, but it is faster to do the compiling\\nand linking in one step, so that’s how it’s done.\\n\\nYacc for C programs\\n\\nn.c is made automatically from n.y by running Yacc with the recipe ‘$(YACC)\\n$(YFLAGS)’.\\n\\nLex for C programs\\n\\nn.c is made automatically from n.l by running Lex. The actual recipe is\\n‘$(LEX) $(LFLAGS)’.\\n\\nLex for Ratfor programs\\n\\nn.r is made automatically from n.l by running Lex. The actual recipe is\\n‘$(LEX) $(LFLAGS)’.\\n\\nThe convention of using the same suffix ‘.l’ for all Lex files regardless of whether\\nthey produce C code or Ratfor code makes it impossible for make to determine\\nautomatically which of the two languages you are using in any particular case. If\\nmake is called upon to remake an object file from a ‘.l’ file, it must guess which\\ncompiler to use. It will guess the C compiler, because that is more common.\\nIf you are using Ratfor, make sure make knows this by mentioning n.r in the\\nmakefile. Or, if you are using Ratfor exclusively, with no C files, remove ‘.c’\\nfrom the list of implicit rule suffixes with:\\n\\n.SUFFIXES:\\n.SUFFIXES: .o .r .f .l ...\\n\\nMaking Lint Libraries from C, Yacc, or Lex programs\\n\\nn.ln is made from n.c by running lint.\\nThe precise recipe is\\n‘$(LINT) $(LINTFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -i’. The same recipe is used on the C\\ncode produced from n.y or n.l.\\n\\nTEX and Web\\n\\nn.dvi is made from n.tex with the recipe ‘$(TEX)’. n.tex is made from n.web\\nwith ‘$(WEAVE)’, or from n.w (and from n.ch if it exists or can be made) with\\n‘$(CWEAVE)’. n.p is made from n.web with ‘$(TANGLE)’ and n.c is made from\\nn.w (and from n.ch if it exists or can be made) with ‘$(CTANGLE)’.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n125\\n\\nTexinfo and Info\\n\\nRCS\\n\\nSCCS\\n\\nn.dvi is made from n.texinfo, n.texi, or n.txinfo, with the recipe\\n‘$(TEXI2DVI) $(TEXI2DVI_FLAGS)’. n.info is made from n.texinfo, n.texi,\\nor n.txinfo, with the recipe ‘$(MAKEINFO) $(MAKEINFO_FLAGS)’.\\n\\nAny file n is extracted if necessary from an RCS file named either n,v or\\nRCS/n,v. The precise recipe used is ‘$(CO) $(COFLAGS)’. n will not be ex-\\ntracted from RCS if it already exists, even if the RCS file is newer. The\\nrules for RCS are terminal (see Section 10.5.5 [Match-Anything Pattern Rules],\\npage 134), so RCS files cannot be generated from another source; they must\\nactually exist.\\n\\nAny file n is extracted if necessary from an SCCS file named either s.n or\\nSCCS/s.n. The precise recipe used is ‘$(GET) $(GFLAGS)’. The rules for SCCS\\nare terminal (see Section 10.5.5 [Match-Anything Pattern Rules], page 134), so\\nSCCS files cannot be generated from another source; they must actually exist.\\n\\nFor the benefit of SCCS, a file n is copied from n.sh and made executable\\n(by everyone). This is for shell scripts that are checked into SCCS. Since RCS\\npreserves the execution permission of a file, you do not need to use this feature\\nwith RCS.\\n\\nWe recommend that you avoid using of SCCS. RCS is widely held to be superior,\\nand is also free. By choosing free software in place of comparable (or inferior)\\nproprietary software, you support the free software movement.\\n\\nUsually, you want to change only the variables listed in the table above, which are\\n\\ndocumented in the following section.\\n\\nHowever, the recipes in built-in implicit rules actually use variables such as COMPILE.c,\\n\\nLINK.p, and PREPROCESS.S, whose values contain the recipes listed above.\\n\\nmake follows the convention that the rule to compile a .x source file uses the variable\\nCOMPILE.x. Similarly, the rule to produce an executable from a .x file uses LINK.x; and\\nthe rule to preprocess a .x file uses PREPROCESS.x.\\n\\nEvery rule that produces an object file uses the variable OUTPUT_OPTION. make defines\\nthis variable either to contain ‘-o $@’, or to be empty, depending on a compile-time option.\\nYou need the ‘-o’ option to ensure that the output goes into the right file when the source\\nfile is in a different directory, as when using VPATH (see Section 4.4 [Directory Search],\\npage 27). However, compilers on some systems do not accept a ‘-o’ switch for object files.\\nIf you use such a system, and use VPATH, some compilations will put their output in the\\nwrong place. A possible workaround for this problem is to give OUTPUT_OPTION the value\\n‘; mv $*.o $@’.\\n\\n10.3 Variables Used by Implicit Rules\\n\\nThe recipes in built-in implicit rules make liberal use of certain predefined variables. You\\ncan alter the values of these variables in the makefile, with arguments to make, or in the en-\\nvironment to alter how the implicit rules work without redefining the rules themselves. You\\ncan cancel all variables used by implicit rules with the ‘-R’ or ‘--no-builtin-variables’\\noption.\\n\\n\\x0c126\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nFor example, the recipe used to compile a C source file actually says ‘$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS)\\n$(CPPFLAGS)’. The default values of the variables used are ‘cc’ and nothing, resulting in\\nthe command ‘cc -c’. By redefining ‘CC’ to ‘ncc’, you could cause ‘ncc’ to be used for\\nall C compilations performed by the implicit rule. By redefining ‘CFLAGS’ to be ‘-g’, you\\ncould pass the ‘-g’ option to each compilation. All implicit rules that do C compilation use\\n‘$(CC)’ to get the program name for the compiler and all include ‘$(CFLAGS)’ among the\\narguments given to the compiler.\\n\\nThe variables used in implicit rules fall into two classes: those that are names of programs\\n(like CC) and those that contain arguments for the programs (like CFLAGS). (The “name of\\na program” may also contain some command arguments, but it must start with an actual\\nexecutable program name.) If a variable value contains more than one argument, separate\\nthem with spaces.\\n\\nThe following tables describe of some of the more commonly-used predefined variables.\\nThis list is not exhaustive, and the default values shown here may not be what make selects\\nfor your environment. To see the complete list of predefined variables for your instance of\\nGNU make you can run ‘make -p’ in a directory with no makefiles.\\n\\nHere is a table of some of the more common variables used as names of programs in\\n\\nbuilt-in rules:\\n\\nAR\\n\\nAS\\n\\nCC\\n\\nCXX\\n\\nCPP\\n\\nFC\\n\\nM2C\\n\\nPC\\n\\nCO\\n\\nGET\\n\\nLEX\\n\\nYACC\\n\\nLINT\\n\\nArchive-maintaining program; default ‘ar’.\\n\\nProgram for compiling assembly files; default ‘as’.\\n\\nProgram for compiling C programs; default ‘cc’.\\n\\nProgram for compiling C++ programs; default ‘g++’.\\n\\nProgram for running the C preprocessor, with results to standard output; de-\\nfault ‘$(CC) -E’.\\n\\nProgram for compiling or preprocessing Fortran and Ratfor programs; default\\n‘f77’.\\n\\nProgram to use to compile Modula-2 source code; default ‘m2c’.\\n\\nProgram for compiling Pascal programs; default ‘pc’.\\n\\nProgram for extracting a file from RCS; default ‘co’.\\n\\nProgram for extracting a file from SCCS; default ‘get’.\\n\\nProgram to use to turn Lex grammars into source code; default ‘lex’.\\n\\nProgram to use to turn Yacc grammars into source code; default ‘yacc’.\\n\\nProgram to use to run lint on source code; default ‘lint’.\\n\\nMAKEINFO Program to convert a Texinfo source file into an Info file; default ‘makeinfo’.\\nProgram to make TEX dvi files from TEX source; default ‘tex’.\\nTEX\\nTEXI2DVI Program to make TEX dvi files from Texinfo source; default ‘texi2dvi’.\\nWEAVE\\n\\nProgram to translate Web into TEX; default ‘weave’.\\nProgram to translate C Web into TEX; default ‘cweave’.\\n\\nCWEAVE\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n127\\n\\nTANGLE\\n\\nProgram to translate Web into Pascal; default ‘tangle’.\\n\\nCTANGLE\\n\\nProgram to translate C Web into C; default ‘ctangle’.\\n\\nRM\\n\\nCommand to remove a file; default ‘rm -f’.\\n\\nHere is a table of variables whose values are additional arguments for the programs\\n\\nabove.

For example, a file n.o could\\nbe made from n.y by running first Yacc and then cc. Such a sequence is called a chain.\\n\\nIf the file n.c exists, or is mentioned in the makefile, no special searching is required:\\nmake finds that the object file can be made by C compilation from n.c; later on, when\\nconsidering how to make n.c, the rule for running Yacc is used. Ultimately both n.c and\\nn.o are updated.\\n\\nHowever, even if n.c does not exist and is not mentioned, make knows how to envision\\nit as the missing link between n.o and n.y! In this case, n.c is called an intermediate file.\\n\\n\\x0c128\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nOnce make has decided to use the intermediate file, it is entered in the data base as if it had\\nbeen mentioned in the makefile, along with the implicit rule that says how to create it.\\n\\nIntermediate files are remade using their rules just like all other files. But intermediate\\n\\nfiles are treated differently in two ways.\\n\\nThe first difference is what happens if the intermediate file does not exist. If an ordinary\\nfile b does not exist, and make considers a target that depends on b, it invariably creates b\\nand then updates the target from b. But if b is an intermediate file, then make can leave\\nwell enough alone:\\nit won’t create b unless one of its prerequisites is out of date. This\\nmeans the target depending on b won’t be rebuilt either, unless there is some other reason\\nfor example the target doesn’t exist or a different prerequisite is\\nto update that target:\\nnewer than the target.\\n\\nThe second difference is that if make does create b in order to update something else,\\nit deletes b later on after it is no longer needed. Therefore, an intermediate file which did\\nnot exist before make also does not exist after make. make reports the deletion to you by\\nprinting a ‘rm’ command showing which file it is deleting.\\n\\nYou can explicitly mark a file as intermediate by listing it as a prerequisite of the special\\ntarget .INTERMEDIATE. This takes effect even if the file is mentioned explicitly in some\\nother way.\\n\\nA file cannot be intermediate if it is mentioned in the makefile as a target or prerequisite,\\nso one way to avoid the deletion of intermediate files is by adding it as a prerequisite to\\nsome target. However, doing so can cause make to do extra work when searching pattern\\nrules (see Section 10.8 [Implicit Rule Search Algorithm], page 137).\\n\\nAs an alternative, listing a file as a prerequisite of the special target .NOTINTERMEDIATE\\nforces it to not be considered intermediate (just as any other mention of the file will do).\\nAlso, listing the target pattern of a pattern rule as a prerequisite of .NOTINTERMEDIATE\\nensures that no targets generated using that pattern rule are considered intermediate.\\n\\nYou can disable intermediate files completely in your makefile by providing\\n.NOTINTERMEDIATE as a target with no prerequisites: in that case it applies to every file in\\nthe makefile.\\n\\nIf you do not want make to create a file merely because it does not already exist, but\\nyou also do not want make to automatically delete the file, you can mark it as a secondary\\nfile. To do this, list it as a prerequisite of the special target .SECONDARY. Marking a file as\\nsecondary also marks it as intermediate.\\n\\nA chain can involve more than two implicit rules. For example, it is possible to make a\\nfile foo from RCS/foo.y,v by running RCS, Yacc and cc. Then both foo.y and foo.c are\\nintermediate files that are deleted at the end.\\n\\nNo single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain. This means that make\\nwill not even consider such a ridiculous thing as making foo from foo.o.o by running the\\nlinker twice. This constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the\\nsearch for an implicit rule chain.\\n\\nThere are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would otherwise\\nbe handled by rule chains. For example, making foo from foo.c could be handled by\\ncompiling and linking with separate chained rules, using foo.o as an intermediate file. But\\nwhat actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the compilation and linking\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n129\\n\\nwith a single cc command. The optimized rule is used in preference to the step-by-step\\nchain because it comes earlier in the ordering of rules.\\n\\nFinally, for performance reasons make will not consider non-terminal match-anything\\nrules (i.e., ‘%:’) when searching for a rule to build a prerequisite of an implicit rule (see\\nSection 10.5.5 [Match-Anything Rules], page 134).\\n\\n10.5 Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules\\n\\nYou define an implicit rule by writing a pattern rule. A pattern rule looks like an ordinary\\nrule, except that its target contains the character ‘%’ (exactly one of them). The target is\\nconsidered a pattern for matching file names; the ‘%’ can match any nonempty substring,\\nwhile other characters match only themselves. The prerequisites likewise use ‘%’ to show\\nhow their names relate to the target name.\\n\\nThus, a pattern rule ‘%.o : %.c’ says how to make any file stem.o from another file\\n\\nstem.c.\\n\\nNote that expansion using ‘%’ in pattern rules occurs after any variable or function ex-\\npansions, which take place when the makefile is read. See Chapter 6 [How to Use Variables],\\npage 65, and Chapter 8 [Functions for Transforming Text], page 91.\\n\\n10.5.1 Introduction to Pattern Rules\\nA pattern rule contains the character ‘%’ (exactly one of them) in the target; otherwise, it\\nlooks exactly like an ordinary rule. The target is a pattern for matching file names; the ‘%’\\nmatches any nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves.\\n\\nFor example, ‘%.c’ as a pattern matches any file name that ends in ‘.c’.\\n\\n‘s.%.c’ as\\na pattern matches any file name that starts with ‘s.’, ends in ‘.c’ and is at least five\\ncharacters long. (There must be at least one character to match the ‘%’.) The substring\\nthat the ‘%’ matches is called the stem.\\n\\n‘%’ in a prerequisite of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that was matched by the\\n‘%’ in the target. In order for the pattern rule to apply, its target pattern must match the\\nfile name under consideration and all of its prerequisites (after pattern substitution) must\\nname files that exist or can be made. These files become prerequisites of the target.\\n\\nThus, a rule of the form\\n\\n%.o : %.c ; recipe...\\n\\nspecifies how to make a file n.o, with another file n.c as its prerequisite, provided that n.c\\nexists or can be made.\\n\\nThere may also be prerequisites that do not use ‘%’; such a prerequisite attaches to every\\n\\nfile made by this pattern rule. These unvarying prerequisites are useful occasionally.\\n\\nA pattern rule need not have any prerequisites that contain ‘%’, or in fact any prerequi-\\nsites at all. Such a rule is effectively a general wildcard. It provides a way to make any file\\nthat matches the target pattern. See Section 10.6 [Last Resort], page 135.\\n\\nMore than one pattern rule may match a target. In this case make will choose the “best\\n\\nfit” rule. See Section 10.5.4 [How Patterns Match], page 133.\\n\\nPattern rules may have more than one target; however, every target must contain a %\\ncharacter. Multiple target patterns in pattern rules are always treated as grouped targets\\n\\n\\x0c130\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n(see Section 4.9 [Multiple Targets in a Rule], page 37) regardless of whether they use the :\\nor &: separator.\\n\\nThere is one exception:\\n\\nif a pattern target is out of date or does not exist and the\\nmakefile does not need to build it, then it will not cause the other targets to be considered\\nout of date. Note that this historical exception will be removed in future versions of GNU\\nmake and should not be relied on. If this situation is detected make will generate a warning\\npattern recipe did not update peer target; however, make cannot detect all such situations.\\nPlease be sure that your recipe updates all the target patterns when it runs.\\n\\n10.5.2 Pattern Rule Examples\\nHere are some examples of pattern rules actually predefined in make. First, the rule that\\ncompiles ‘.c’ files into ‘.o’ files:\\n\\n%.o : %.c\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\ndefines a rule that can make any file x.o from x.c. The recipe uses the automatic variables\\n‘$@’ and ‘$<’ to substitute the names of the target file and the source file in each case where\\nthe rule applies (see Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130).\\n\\nHere is a second built-in rule:\\n\\n% :: RCS/%,v\\n\\n$(CO) $(COFLAGS) $<\\n\\ndefines a rule that can make any file x whatsoever from a corresponding file x,v in the sub-\\ndirectory RCS. Since the target is ‘%’, this rule will apply to any file whatever, provided the\\nappropriate prerequisite file exists. The double colon makes the rule terminal, which means\\nthat its prerequisite may not be an intermediate file (see Section 10.5.5 [Match-Anything\\nPattern Rules], page 134).\\n\\nThis pattern rule has two targets:\\n\\n%.tab.c %.tab.h: %.y\\n\\nbison -d $<\\n\\nThis tells make that the recipe ‘bison -d x.y’ will make both x.tab.c and x.tab.h. If\\nthe file foo depends on the files parse.tab.o and scan.o and the file scan.o depends\\non the file parse.tab.h, when parse.y is changed, the recipe ‘bison -d parse.y’ will be\\nexecuted only once, and the prerequisites of both parse.tab.o and scan.o will be satisfied.\\n(Presumably the file parse.tab.o will be recompiled from parse.tab.c and the file scan.o\\nfrom scan.c, while foo is linked from parse.tab.o, scan.o, and its other prerequisites,\\nand it will execute happily ever after.)\\n\\n10.5.3 Automatic Variables\\nSuppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a ‘.c’ file into a ‘.o’ file: how do you\\nwrite the ‘cc’ command so that it operates on the right source file name? You cannot write\\nthe name in the recipe, because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.\\n\\nWhat you do is use a special feature of make, the automatic variables. These variables\\nhave values computed afresh for each rule that is executed, based on the target and prereq-\\nuisites of the rule. In this example, you would use ‘$@’ for the object file name and ‘$<’ for\\nthe source file name.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n131\\n\\nIt’s very important that you recognize the limited scope in which automatic variable\\nvalues are available: they only have values within the recipe. In particular, you cannot use\\nthem anywhere within the target list of a rule; they have no value there and will expand\\nto the empty string. Also, they cannot be accessed directly within the prerequisite list\\nof a rule. A common mistake is attempting to use $@ within the prerequisites list; this\\nwill not work. However, there is a special feature of GNU make, secondary expansion (see\\nSection 3.9 [Secondary Expansion], page 19), which will allow automatic variable values to\\nbe used in prerequisite lists.\\n\\nHere is a table of automatic variables:\\n\\n$@\\n\\n$%\\n\\n$<\\n\\n$?\\n\\n$^\\n\\n$+\\n\\n$|\\n\\nThe file name of the target of the rule. If the target is an archive member, then\\n‘$@’ is the name of the archive file. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets\\n(see Section 10.5.1 [Introduction to Pattern Rules], page 129), ‘$@’ is the name\\nof whichever target caused the rule’s recipe to be run.\\n\\nThe target member name, when the target is an archive member.\\nSee\\nChapter 11 [Archives], page 139. For example, if the target is foo.a(bar.o)\\nthen ‘$%’ is bar.o and ‘$@’ is foo.a.\\n‘$%’ is empty when the target is not an\\narchive member.\\n\\nThe name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its recipe from an implicit\\nrule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the implicit rule (see Chapter 10\\n[Implicit Rules], page 121).\\n\\nThe names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces\\nbetween them. If the target does not exist, all prerequisites will be included.\\nFor prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used\\n(see Chapter 11 [Archives], page 139).\\n\\n‘$?’ is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only the pre-\\nrequisites that have changed. For example, suppose that an archive named lib\\nis supposed to contain copies of several object files. This rule copies just the\\nchanged object files into the archive:\\n\\nlib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o\\n\\nar r lib $?\\n\\nThe names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them. For prerequisites\\nwhich are archive members, only the named member is used (see Chapter 11\\n[Archives], page 139). A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it\\ndepends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite. So\\nif you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value of $^ contains\\njust one copy of the name. This list does not contain any of the order-only\\nprerequisites; for those see the ‘$|’ variable, below.\\n\\nThis is like ‘$^’, but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated in the\\norder they were listed in the makefile. This is primarily useful for use in linking\\ncommands where it is meaningful to repeat library file names in a particular\\norder.\\n\\nThe names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between them.\\n\\n\\x0c132\\n\\n$*\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThe stem with which an implicit rule matches (see Section 10.5.4 [How Patterns\\nMatch], page 133). If the target is dir/a.foo.b and the target pattern is a.%.b\\nthen the stem is dir/foo. The stem is useful for constructing names of related\\nfiles.\\nIn a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched the ‘%’\\nin the target pattern.\\nIn an explicit rule, there is no stem; so ‘$*’ cannot be determined in that way.\\nInstead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix (see Section 10.7 [Old-\\nFashioned Suffix Rules], page 136), ‘$*’ is set to the target name minus the\\nsuffix. For example, if the target name is ‘foo.c’, then ‘$*’ is set to ‘foo’, since\\n‘.c’ is a suffix. GNU make does this bizarre thing only for compatibility with\\nother implementations of make. You should generally avoid using ‘$*’ except in\\nimplicit rules or static pattern rules.\\nIf the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a recognized suffix, ‘$*’\\nis set to the empty string for that rule.\\n\\nOf the variables listed above, four have values that are single file names, and three have\\nvalues that are lists of file names. These seven have variants that get just the file’s directory\\nname or just the file name within the directory. The variant variables’ names are formed\\nby appending ‘D’ or ‘F’, respectively. The functions dir and notdir can be used to obtain\\na similar effect (see Section 8.3 [Functions for File Names], page 95). Note, however, that\\nthe ‘D’ variants all omit the trailing slash which always appears in the output of the dir\\nfunction. Here is a table of the variants:\\n\\n‘$(@D)’\\n\\n‘$(@F)’\\n\\n‘$(*D)’\\n‘$(*F)’\\n\\n‘$(%D)’\\n‘$(%F)’\\n\\n‘$(<D)’\\n‘$(<F)’\\n\\n‘$(^D)’\\n‘$(^F)’\\n\\n‘$(+D)’\\n‘$(+F)’\\n\\nThe directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing slash removed.\\nIf the value of ‘$@’ is dir/foo.o then ‘$(@D)’ is dir. This value is . if ‘$@’ does\\nnot contain a slash.\\n\\nThe file-within-directory part of the file name of the target. If the value of ‘$@’\\nis dir/foo.o then ‘$(@F)’ is foo.o. ‘$(@F)’ is equivalent to ‘$(notdir $@)’.\\n\\nThe directory part and the file-within-directory part of the stem; dir and foo\\nin this example.\\n\\nThe directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target archive mem-\\nber name. This makes sense only for archive member targets of the form\\narchive(member) and is useful only when member may contain a directory\\nname. (See Section 11.1 [Archive Members as Targets], page 139.)\\n\\nThe directory part and the file-within-directory part of the first prerequisite.\\n\\nLists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequi-\\nsites.\\n\\nLists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequi-\\nsites, including multiple instances of duplicated prerequisites.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n133\\n\\n‘$(?D)’\\n‘$(?F)’\\n\\nLists of the directory parts and the file-within-directory parts of all prerequisites\\nthat are newer than the target.\\n\\nNote that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about these automatic\\nvariables; we write “the value of ‘$<’”, rather than “the variable <” as we would write\\nfor ordinary variables such as objects and CFLAGS. We think this convention looks more\\nnatural in this special case. Please do not assume it has a deep significance; ‘$<’ refers to\\nthe variable named < just as ‘$(CFLAGS)’ refers to the variable named CFLAGS. You could\\njust as well use ‘$(<)’ in place of ‘$<’.\\n\\n10.5.4 How Patterns Match\\nA target pattern is composed of a ‘%’ between a prefix and a suffix, either or both of which\\nmay be empty. The pattern matches a file name only if the file name starts with the prefix\\nand ends with the suffix, without overlap. The text between the prefix and the suffix is\\ncalled the stem. Thus, when the pattern ‘%.o’ matches the file name test.o, the stem is\\n‘test’. The pattern rule prerequisites are turned into actual file names by substituting the\\nstem for the character ‘%’. Thus, if in the same example one of the prerequisites is written\\nas ‘%.c’, it expands to ‘test.c’.\\n\\nWhen the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does not), directory\\nnames in the file names are removed from the file name before it is compared with the target\\nprefix and suffix. After the comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory\\nnames, along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the prerequisite file names\\ngenerated from the pattern rule’s prerequisite patterns and the file name. The directories\\nare ignored only for the purpose of finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application\\nof that rule. Thus, ‘e%t’ matches the file name src/eat, with ‘src/a’ as the stem. When\\nprerequisites are turned into file names, the directories from the stem are added at the front,\\nwhile the rest of the stem is substituted for the ‘%’. The stem ‘src/a’ with a prerequisite\\npattern ‘c%r’ gives the file name src/car.\\n\\nA pattern rule can be used to build a given file only if there is a target pattern that\\nmatches the file name, and all prerequisites in that rule either exist or can be built. The\\nrules you write take precedence over those that are built in. Note however, that a rule\\nwhich can be satisfied without chaining other implicit rules (for example, one which has no\\nprerequisites or its prerequisites already exist or are mentioned) always takes priority over\\na rule with prerequisites that must be made by chaining other implicit rules.\\n\\nIt is possible that more than one pattern rule will meet these criteria.\\n\\nIn that case,\\nmake will choose the rule with the shortest stem (that is, the pattern that matches most\\nspecifically). If more than one pattern rule has the shortest stem, make will choose the first\\none found in the makefile.\\n\\nThis algorithm results in more specific rules being preferred over more generic ones; for\\n\\nexample:\\n\\n%.o: %.c\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\n%.o : %.f\\n\\n$(COMPILE.F) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $<\\n\\n\\x0c134\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nlib/%.o: lib/%.c\\n\\n$(CC) -fPIC -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@\\n\\nGiven these rules and asked to build bar.o where both bar.c and bar.f exist, make\\nwill choose the first rule and compile bar.c into bar.o. In the same situation where bar.c\\ndoes not exist, then make will choose the second rule and compile bar.f into bar.o.\\n\\nIf make is asked to build lib/bar.o and both lib/bar.c and lib/bar.f exist, then the\\nthird rule will be chosen since the stem for this rule (‘bar’) is shorter than the stem for the\\nfirst rule (‘lib/bar’). If lib/bar.c does not exist then the third rule is not eligible and\\nthe second rule will be used, even though the stem is longer.\\n\\n10.5.5 Match-Anything Pattern Rules\\nWhen a pattern rule’s target is just ‘%’, it matches any file name whatever. We call these\\nrules match-anything rules. They are very useful, but it can take a lot of time for make to\\nthink about them, because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed either\\nas a target or as a prerequisite.\\n\\nSuppose the makefile mentions foo.c. For this target, make would have to consider\\nmaking it by linking an object file foo.c.o, or by C compilation-and-linking in one step from\\nfoo.c.c, or by Pascal compilation-and-linking from foo.c.p, and many other possibilities.\\n\\nWe know these possibilities are ridiculous since foo.c is a C source file, not an executable.\\nIf make did consider these possibilities, it would ultimately reject them, because files such\\nas foo.c.o and foo.c.p would not exist. But these possibilities are so numerous that make\\nwould run very slowly if it had to consider them.\\n\\nTo gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way make considers match-anything\\nrules. There are two different constraints that can be applied, and each time you define a\\nmatch-anything rule you must choose one or the other for that rule.\\n\\nOne choice is to mark the match-anything rule as terminal by defining it with a double\\ncolon. When a rule is terminal, it does not apply unless its prerequisites actually exist.\\nPrerequisites that could be made with other implicit rules are not good enough. In other\\nwords, no further chaining is allowed beyond a terminal rule.\\n\\nFor example, the built-in implicit rules for extracting sources from RCS and SCCS files\\nare terminal; as a result, if the file foo.c,v does not exist, make will not even consider\\ntrying to make it as an intermediate file from foo.c,v.o or from RCS/SCCS/s.foo.c,v.\\nRCS and SCCS files are generally ultimate source files, which should not be remade from\\nany other files; therefore, make can save time by not looking for ways to remake them.\\n\\nIf you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is non-terminal. A\\nnon-terminal match-anything rule cannot apply to a prerequisite of an implicit rule, or to\\na file name that indicates a specific type of data. A file name indicates a specific type of\\ndata if some non-match-anything implicit rule target matches it.\\n\\nFor example, the file name foo.c matches the target for the pattern rule ‘%.c : %.y’ (the\\nrule to run Yacc). Regardless of whether this rule is actually applicable (which happens only\\nif there is a file foo.y), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent consideration of\\nany non-terminal match-anything rules for the file foo.c. Thus, make will not even consider\\ntrying to make foo.c as an executable file from foo.c.o, foo.c.c, foo.c.p, etc.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n135\\n\\nThe motivation for this constraint is that non-terminal match-anything rules are used\\nfor making files containing specific types of data (such as executable files) and a file name\\nwith a recognized suffix indicates some other specific type of data (such as a C source file).\\nSpecial built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize certain file names\\nso that non-terminal match-anything rules will not be considered. These dummy rules have\\nno prerequisites and no recipes, and they are ignored for all other purposes. For example,\\nthe built-in implicit rule\\n\\n%.p :\\n\\nexists to make sure that Pascal source files such as foo.p match a specific target pattern\\nand thereby prevent time from being wasted looking for foo.p.o or foo.p.c.\\n\\nDummy pattern rules such as the one for ‘%.p’ are made for every suffix listed as valid\\n\\nfor use in suffix rules (see Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules], page 136).\\n\\n10.5.6 Canceling Implicit Rules\\nYou can override a built-in implicit rule (or one you have defined yourself) by defining a\\nnew pattern rule with the same target and prerequisites, but a different recipe. When the\\nnew rule is defined, the built-in one is replaced. The new rule’s position in the sequence of\\nimplicit rules is determined by where you write the new rule.\\n\\nYou can cancel a built-in implicit rule by defining a pattern rule with the same target\\nand prerequisites, but no recipe. For example, the following would cancel the rule that runs\\nthe assembler:\\n\\n%.o : %.s\\n\\n10.6 Defining Last-Resort Default Rules\\n\\nYou can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal match-anything pattern rule\\nwith no prerequisites (see Section 10.5.5 [Match-Anything Rules], page 134). This is just\\nlike any other pattern rule; the only thing special about it is that it will match any target.\\nSo such a rule’s recipe is used for all targets and prerequisites that have no recipe of their\\nown and for which no other implicit rule applies.\\n\\nFor example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source files contain real\\n\\ndata, only that they exist. Then you might do this:\\n\\n%::\\n\\ntouch $@\\n\\nto cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created automatically.\\n\\nYou can instead define a recipe to be used for targets for which there are no rules at\\nall, even ones which don’t specify recipes. You do this by writing a rule for the target\\n.DEFAULT. Such a rule’s recipe is used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets\\nin any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies. Naturally, there is no .DEFAULT\\nrule unless you write one.\\n\\nIf you use .DEFAULT with no recipe or prerequisites:\\n\\n.DEFAULT:\\n\\nthe recipe previously stored for .DEFAULT is cleared. Then make acts as if you had never\\ndefined .DEFAULT at all.\\n\\n\\x0c136\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nIf you do not want a target to get the recipe from a match-anything pattern rule or\\n.DEFAULT, but you also do not want any recipe to be run for the target, you can give it an\\nempty recipe (see Section 5.9 [Defining Empty Recipes], page 62).\\n\\nYou can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile. See Section 3.6\\n\\n[Overriding Part of Another Makefile], page 16.\\n\\n10.7 Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules\\n\\nSuffix rules are the old-fashioned way of defining implicit rules for make. Suffix rules are\\nobsolete because pattern rules are more general and clearer. They are supported in GNU\\nmake for compatibility with old makefiles. They come in two kinds: double-suffix and\\nsingle-suffix.\\n\\nA double-suffix rule is defined by a pair of suffixes: the target suffix and the source\\nIt matches any file whose name ends with the target suffix. The corresponding\\nsuffix.\\nimplicit prerequisite is made by replacing the target suffix with the source suffix in the\\nfile name. A two-suffix rule ‘.c.o’ (whose target and source suffixes are ‘.o’ and ‘.c’) is\\nequivalent to the pattern rule ‘%.o : %.c’.\\n\\nA single-suffix rule is defined by a single suffix, which is the source suffix. It matches\\nany file name, and the corresponding implicit prerequisite name is made by appending the\\nsource suffix. A single-suffix rule whose source suffix is ‘.c’ is equivalent to the pattern rule\\n‘% : %.c’.\\n\\nSuffix rule definitions are recognized by comparing each rule’s target against a defined\\nlist of known suffixes. When make sees a rule whose target is a known suffix, this rule is\\nconsidered a single-suffix rule. When make sees a rule whose target is two known suffixes\\nconcatenated, this rule is taken as a double-suffix rule.\\n\\nFor example, ‘.c’ and ‘.o’ are both on the default list of known suffixes. Therefore,\\nif you define a rule whose target is ‘.c.o’, make takes it to be a double-suffix rule with\\nsource suffix ‘.c’ and target suffix ‘.o’. Here is the old-fashioned way to define the rule for\\ncompiling a C source file:\\n\\n.c.o:\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<\\n\\nSuffix rules cannot have any prerequisites of their own. If they have any, they are treated\\n\\nas normal files with funny names, not as suffix rules. Thus, the rule:\\n\\n.c.o: foo.h\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<\\n\\ntells how to make the file .c.o from the prerequisite file foo.h, and is not at all like the\\npattern rule:\\n\\n%.o: %.c foo.h\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $@ $<\\n\\nwhich tells how to make ‘.o’ files from ‘.c’ files, and makes all ‘.o’ files using this pattern\\nrule also depend on foo.h.\\n\\nSuffix rules with no recipe are also meaningless. They do not remove previous rules as\\ndo pattern rules with no recipe (see Section 10.5.6 [Canceling Implicit Rules], page 135).\\nThey simply enter the suffix or pair of suffixes concatenated as a target in the data base.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 10: Using Implicit Rules\\n\\n137\\n\\nThe known suffixes are simply the names of the prerequisites of the special target\\n.SUFFIXES. You can add your own suffixes by writing a rule for .SUFFIXES that adds\\nmore prerequisites, as in:\\n\\n.SUFFIXES: .hack .win\\n\\nwhich adds ‘.hack’ and ‘.win’ to the end of the list of suffixes.\\n\\nIf you wish to eliminate the default known suffixes instead of just adding to them, write\\na rule for .SUFFIXES with no prerequisites. By special dispensation, this eliminates all\\nexisting prerequisites of .SUFFIXES. You can then write another rule to add the suffixes\\nyou want. For example,\\n\\n.SUFFIXES:\\n.SUFFIXES: .c .o .h\\n\\n# Delete the default suffixes\\n# Define our suffix list\\n\\nThe ‘-r’ or ‘--no-builtin-rules’ flag causes the default list of suffixes to be empty.\\nThe variable SUFFIXES is defined to the default list of suffixes before make reads any\\nmakefiles. You can change the list of suffixes with a rule for the special target .SUFFIXES,\\nbut that does not alter this variable.\\n\\n10.8 Implicit Rule Search Algorithm\\n\\nHere is the procedure make uses for searching for an implicit rule for a target t. This\\nprocedure is followed for each double-colon rule with no recipe, for each target of ordinary\\nrules none of which have a recipe, and for each prerequisite that is not the target of any\\nrule. It is also followed recursively for prerequisites that come from implicit rules, in the\\nsearch for a chain of rules.\\n\\nSuffix rules are not mentioned in this algorithm because suffix rules are converted to\\n\\nequivalent pattern rules once the makefiles have been read in.\\n\\nFor an archive member target of the form ‘archive(member)’, the following algorithm\\nis run twice, first using the entire target name t, and second using ‘(member)’ as the target\\nt if the first run found no rule.\\n\\n1. Split t into a directory part, called d, and the rest, called n. For example, if t is\\n\\n‘src/foo.o’, then d is ‘src/’ and n is ‘foo.o’.\\n\\n2. Make a list of all the pattern rules one of whose targets matches t or n. If the target\\n\\npattern contains a slash, it is matched against t; otherwise, against n.\\n\\n3. If any rule in that list is not a match-anything rule, or if t is a prerequisite of an implicit\\n\\nrule, then remove all non-terminal match-anything rules from the list.\\n\\n4. Remove from the list all rules with no recipe.\\n\\n5. For each pattern rule in the list:\\n\\na. Find the stem s, which is the nonempty part of t or n matched by the ‘%’ in the\\n\\ntarget pattern.\\n\\nb. Compute the prerequisite names by substituting s for ‘%’; if the target pattern\\n\\ndoes not contain a slash, append d to the front of each prerequisite name.\\n\\nc. Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist. (If a file name is men-\\ntioned in the makefile as a target or as an explicit prerequisite of target T, then\\nwe say it ought to exist.)\\n\\n\\x0c138\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nIf all prerequisites exist or ought to exist, or there are no prerequisites, then this\\nrule applies.\\n\\n6. If no pattern rule has been found so far, try harder. For each pattern rule in the list:\\n\\na. If the rule is terminal, ignore it and go on to the next rule.\\nb. Compute the prerequisite names as before.\\nc. Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist.\\nd. For each prerequisite that does not exist, follow this algorithm recursively to see\\n\\nif the prerequisite can be made by an implicit rule.\\n\\ne. If all prerequisites exist, ought to exist, or can be made by implicit rules, then this\\n\\nrule applies.\\n\\n7. If no pattern rule has been found then try step 5 and step 6 again with a modified\\ndefinition of “ought to exist”:\\nif a filename is mentioned as a target or as an ex-\\nplicit prerequisite of any target, then it ought to exist. This check is only present for\\nbackward-compatibility with older versions of GNU Make: we don’t recommend relying\\non it.\\n\\n8. If no implicit rule applies, the rule for .DEFAULT, if any, applies. In that case, give t\\n\\nthe same recipe that .DEFAULT has. Otherwise, there is no recipe for t.\\n\\nOnce a rule that applies has been found, for each target pattern of the rule other than\\nthe one that matched t or n, the ‘%’ in the pattern is replaced with s and the resultant\\nfile name is stored until the recipe to remake the target file t is executed. After the recipe\\nis executed, each of these stored file names are entered into the data base and marked as\\nhaving been updated and having the same update status as the file t.\\n\\nWhen the recipe of a pattern rule is executed for t, the automatic variables are set\\ncorresponding to the target and prerequisites. See Section 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables],\\npage 130.\\n\\n\\x0c139\\n\\n11 Using make to Update Archive Files\\n\\nArchive files are files containing named sub-files called members; they are maintained with\\nthe program ar and their main use is as subroutine libraries for linking.\\n\\n11.1 Archive Members as Targets\\n\\nAn individual member of an archive file can be used as a target or prerequisite in make.\\nYou specify the member named member in archive file archive as follows:\\n\\narchive(member)\\n\\nThis construct is available only in targets and prerequisites, not in recipes! Most programs\\nthat you might use in recipes do not support this syntax and cannot act directly on archive\\nmembers. Only ar and other programs specifically designed to operate on archives can do\\nso. Therefore, valid recipes to update an archive member target probably must use ar. For\\nexample, this rule says to create a member hack.o in archive foolib by copying the file\\nhack.o:\\n\\nfoolib(hack.o) : hack.o\\n\\nar cr foolib hack.o\\n\\nIn fact, nearly all archive member targets are updated in just this way and there is an\\nimplicit rule to do it for you. Please note: The ‘c’ flag to ar is required if the archive file\\ndoes not already exist.\\n\\nTo specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the member names\\n\\ntogether between the parentheses. For example:\\n\\nfoolib(hack.o kludge.o)\\n\\nis equivalent to:\\n\\nfoolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)\\n\\nYou can also use shell-style wildcards in an archive member reference. See Section 4.3\\n[Using Wildcard Characters in File Names], page 25. For example, ‘foolib(*.o)’ ex-\\npands to all existing members of the foolib archive whose names end in ‘.o’; perhaps\\n‘foolib(hack.o) foolib(kludge.o)’.\\n\\n11.2 Implicit Rule for Archive Member Targets\\n\\nRecall that a target that looks like a(m) stands for the member named m in the archive file\\na.\\n\\nWhen make looks for an implicit rule for such a target, as a special feature it considers\\n\\nimplicit rules that match (m), as well as those that match the actual target a(m).\\n\\nThis causes one special rule whose target is (%) to match. This rule updates the target\\na(m) by copying the file m into the archive. For example, it will update the archive member\\ntarget foo.a(bar.o) by copying the file bar.o into the archive foo.a as a member named\\nbar.o.\\n\\nWhen this rule is chained with others, the result is very powerful. Thus,\\n\\n‘make\\n\"foo.a(bar.o)\"’ (the quotes are needed to protect the ‘(’ and ‘)’ from being interpreted\\n\\n\\x0c140\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nspecially by the shell) in the presence of a file bar.c is enough to cause the following\\nrecipe to be run, even without a makefile:\\n\\ncc -c bar.c -o bar.o\\nar r foo.a bar.o\\nrm -f bar.o\\n\\nHere make has envisioned the file bar.o as an intermediate file. See Section 10.4 [Chains of\\nImplicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\nImplicit rules such as this one are written using the automatic variable ‘$%’. See\\n\\nSection 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130.\\n\\nAn archive member name in an archive cannot contain a directory name, but it may\\nIf you write an archive member target\\n\\nbe useful in a makefile to pretend that it does.\\nfoo.a(dir/file.o), make will perform automatic updating with this recipe:\\n\\nar r foo.a dir/file.o\\n\\nwhich has the effect of copying the file dir/file.o into a member named file.o.\\nconnection with such usage, the automatic variables %D and %F may be useful.\\n\\nIn\\n\\n11.2.1 Updating Archive Symbol Directories\\nAn archive file that is used as a library usually contains a special member named __.SYMDEF\\nthat contains a directory of the external symbol names defined by all the other members.\\nAfter you update any other members, you need to update __.SYMDEF so that it will sum-\\nmarize the other members properly. This is done by running the ranlib program:\\n\\nranlib archivefile\\n\\nNormally you would put this command in the rule for the archive file, and make all the\\n\\nmembers of the archive file prerequisites of that rule. For example,\\n\\nlibfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o y.o ...)\\nranlib libfoo.a\\n\\nThe effect of this is to update archive members x.o, y.o, etc., and then update the symbol\\ndirectory member __.SYMDEF by running ranlib. The rules for updating the members are\\nnot shown here; most likely you can omit them and use the implicit rule which copies files\\ninto the archive, as described in the preceding section.\\n\\nThis is not necessary when using the GNU ar program, which updates the __.SYMDEF\\n\\nmember automatically.\\n\\n11.3 Dangers When Using Archives\\n\\nThe built-in rules for updating archives are incompatible with parallel builds. These rules\\n(required by the POSIX standard) add each object file into the archive as it’s compiled.\\nWhen parallel builds are enabled this allows multiple ar commands to be updating the\\nsame archive simultaneously, which is not supported.\\n\\nIf you want to use parallel builds with archives you can override the default rules by\\n\\nadding these lines to your makefile:\\n\\n(%) : % ;\\n%.a : ; $(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $@ $?\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 11: Using make to Update Archive Files\\n\\n141\\n\\nThe first line changes the rule that updates an individual object in the archive to do\\nnothing, and the second line changes the default rule for building an archive to update all\\nthe outdated objects ($?) in one command.\\n\\nOf course you will still need to declare the prerequisites of your library using the archive\\n\\nsyntax:\\n\\nlibfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o y.o ...)\\n\\nIf you prefer to write an explicit rule you can use:\\n\\nlibfoo.a: libfoo.a(x.o y.o ...)\\n\\n$(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $@ $?\\n\\n11.4 Suffix Rules for Archive Files\\n\\nYou can write a special kind of suffix rule for dealing with archive files. See Section 10.7\\n[Suffix Rules], page 136, for a full explanation of suffix rules. Archive suffix rules are\\nobsolete in GNU make, because pattern rules for archives are a more general mechanism\\n(see Section 11.2 [Archive Update], page 139). But they are retained for compatibility with\\nother makes.\\n\\nTo write a suffix rule for archives, you simply write a suffix rule using the target suffix\\n‘.a’ (the usual suffix for archive files). For example, here is the old-fashioned suffix rule to\\nupdate a library archive from C source files:\\n\\n.c.a:\\n\\n$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $< -o $*.o\\n$(AR) r $@ $*.o\\n$(RM) $*.o\\n\\nThis works just as if you had written the pattern rule:\\n\\n(%.o): %.c\\n\\n$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) -c $< -o $*.o\\n$(AR) r $@ $*.o\\n$(RM) $*.o\\n\\nIn fact, this is just what make does when it sees a suffix rule with ‘.a’ as the target\\nsuffix. Any double-suffix rule ‘.x.a’ is converted to a pattern rule with the target pattern\\n‘(%.o)’ and a prerequisite pattern of ‘%.x’.\\n\\nSince you might want to use ‘.a’ as the suffix for some other kind of file, make also\\nconverts archive suffix rules to pattern rules in the normal way (see Section 10.7 [Suffix\\n‘(%.o):\\nRules], page 136). Thus a double-suffix rule ‘.x.a’ produces two pattern rules:\\n%.x’ and ‘%.a: %.x’.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c143\\n\\n12 Extending GNU make\\n\\nGNU make provides many advanced capabilities, including many useful functions. However,\\nit does not contain a complete programming language and so it has limitations. Sometimes\\nthese limitations can be overcome through use of the shell function to invoke a separate\\nprogram, although this can be inefficient.\\n\\nIn cases where the built-in capabilities of GNU make are insufficient to your requirements\\nthere are two options for extending make. On systems where it’s provided, you can utilize\\nGNU Guile as an embedded scripting language (see Section 12.1 [GNU Guile Integration],\\npage 143). On systems which support dynamically loadable objects, you can write your\\nown extension in any language (which can be compiled into such an object) and load it to\\nprovide extended capabilities (see Section 12.2.1 [The load Directive], page 146).\\n\\n12.1 GNU Guile Integration\\n\\nGNU make may be built with support for GNU Guile as an embedded extension language.\\nGuile implements the Scheme language. A review of GNU Guile and the Scheme language\\nand its features is beyond the scope of this manual: see the documentation for GNU Guile\\nand Scheme.\\n\\nYou can determine if make contains support for Guile by examining the .FEATURES\\n\\nvariable; it will contain the word guile if Guile support is available.\\n\\nThe Guile integration provides one new make function: guile. The guile function takes\\none argument which is first expanded by make in the normal fashion, then passed to the\\nGNU Guile evaluator. The result of the evaluator is converted into a string and used as the\\nexpansion of the guile function in the makefile.\\n\\nIn addition, GNU make exposes Guile procedures for use in Guile scripts.\\n\\n12.1.1 Conversion of Guile Types\\nThere is only one “data type” in make: a string. GNU Guile, on the other hand, provides\\na rich variety of different data types. An important aspect of the interface between make\\nand GNU Guile is the conversion of Guile data types into make strings.\\n\\nThis conversion is relevant in two places: when a makefile invokes the guile function\\nto evaluate a Guile expression, the result of that evaluation must be converted into a make\\nstring so it can be further evaluated by make. And secondly, when a Guile script invokes\\none of the procedures exported by make the argument provided to the procedure must be\\nconverted into a string.\\n\\nThe conversion of Guile types into make strings is as below:\\n\\n#f\\n\\n#t\\n\\nsymbol\\n\\nnumber\\n\\nFalse is converted into the empty string: in make conditionals the empty string\\nis considered false.\\n\\nTrue is converted to the string ‘#t’: in make conditionals any non-empty string\\nis considered true.\\n\\nA symbol or number is converted into the string representation of that symbol\\nor number.\\n\\n\\x0c144\\n\\ncharacter\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nA printable character is converted to the same character.\\n\\nstring\\n\\nA string containing only printable characters is converted to the same string.\\n\\nlist\\n\\nA list is converted recursively according to the above rules. This implies that\\nany structured list will be flattened (that is, a result of ‘’(a b (c d) e)’ will be\\nconverted to the make string ‘a b c d e’).\\n\\nother\\n\\nAny other Guile type results in an error. In future versions of make, other Guile\\ntypes may be converted.\\n\\nThe translation of ‘#f’ (to the empty string) and ‘#t’ (to the non-empty string ‘#t’) is\\ndesigned to allow you to use Guile boolean results directly as make boolean conditions. For\\nexample:\\n\\n$(if $(guile (access? \"myfile\" R_OK)),$(info myfile exists))\\n\\nAs a consequence of these conversion rules you must consider the result of your Guile\\nscript, as that result will be converted into a string and parsed by make.\\nIf there is no\\nnatural result for the script (that is, the script exists solely for its side-effects), you should\\nadd ‘#f’ as the final expression in order to avoid syntax errors in your makefile.\\n\\n12.1.2 Interfaces from Guile to make\\nIn addition to the guile function available in makefiles, make exposes some procedures for\\nuse in your Guile scripts. At startup make creates a new Guile module, gnu make, and\\nexports these procedures as public interfaces from that module:\\n\\ngmk-expand\\n\\nThis procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a string. The\\nstring is expanded by make using normal make expansion rules. The result of\\nthe expansion is converted into a Guile string and provided as the result of the\\nprocedure.\\n\\ngmk-eval This procedure takes a single argument which is converted into a string. The\\nstring is evaluated by make as if it were a makefile. This is the same capability\\navailable via the eval function (see Section 8.10 [Eval Function], page 103).\\nThe result of the gmk-eval procedure is always the empty string.\\n\\nNote that gmk-eval is not quite the same as using gmk-expand with the eval\\nfunction: in the latter case the evaluated string will be expanded twice; first by\\ngmk-expand, then again by the eval function.\\n\\n12.1.3 Example Using Guile in make\\nHere is a very simple example using GNU Guile to manage writing to a file. These Guile\\nprocedures simply open a file, allow writing to the file (one string per line), and close the file.\\nNote that because we cannot store complex values such as Guile ports in make variables,\\nwe’ll keep the port as a global variable in the Guile interpreter.\\n\\nYou can create Guile functions easily using define/endef to create a Guile script, then\\n\\nuse the guile function to internalize it:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 12: Extending GNU make\\n\\n145\\n\\ndefine GUILEIO\\n;; A simple Guile IO library for GNU Make\\n\\n(define MKPORT #f)\\n\\n(define (mkopen name mode)\\n\\n(set! MKPORT (open-file name mode))\\n#f)\\n\\n(define (mkwrite s)\\n\\n(display s MKPORT)\\n(newline MKPORT)\\n#f)\\n\\n(define (mkclose)\\n\\n(close-port MKPORT)\\n#f)\\n\\n#f\\nendef\\n\\n# Internalize the Guile IO functions\\n$(guile $(GUILEIO))\\n\\nIf you have a significant amount of Guile support code, you might consider keeping it\\nin a different file (e.g., guileio.scm) and then loading it in your makefile using the guile\\nfunction:\\n\\n$(guile (load \"guileio.scm\"))\\n\\nAn advantage to this method is that when editing guileio.scm, your editor will under-\\n\\nstand that this file contains Scheme syntax rather than makefile syntax.\\n\\nNow you can use these Guile functions to create files. Suppose you need to operate on\\na very large list, which cannot fit on the command line, but the utility you’re using accepts\\nthe list as input as well:\\n\\nprog: $(PREREQS)\\n\\n@$(guile (mkopen \"tmp.out\" \"w\")) \\\\\\n\\n$(foreach X,$^,$(guile (mkwrite \"$(X)\"))) \\\\\\n$(guile (mkclose))\\n\\n$(LINK) < tmp.out\\n\\nA more comprehensive suite of file manipulation procedures is possible of course. You\\ncould, for example, maintain multiple output files at the same time by choosing a symbol\\nfor each one and using it as the key to a hash table, where the value is a port, then returning\\nthe symbol to be stored in a make variable.\\n\\n12.2 Loading Dynamic Objects\\n\\n\\x0c146\\n\\n(cid:11)\\n\\n(cid:10)\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nWarning: The load directive and extension capability is considered a “technol-\\nogy preview” in this release of GNU Make. We encourage you to experiment\\nwith this feature and we appreciate any feedback on it. However we cannot\\nguarantee to maintain backward-compatibility in the next release. Consider us-\\ning GNU Guile instead for extending GNU Make (see Section 8.15 [The guile\\nFunction], page 108).\\n\\n(cid:8)\\n\\n(cid:9)\\n\\nMany operating systems provide a facility for dynamically loading compiled objects. If\\nyour system provides this facility, GNU make can make use of it to load dynamic objects at\\nruntime, providing new capabilities which may then be invoked by your makefile.\\n\\nThe load directive is used to load a dynamic object. Once the object is loaded, a “setup”\\nfunction will be invoked to allow the object to initialize itself and register new facilities\\nwith GNU make. A dynamic object might include new make functions, for example, and\\nthe “setup” function would register them with GNU make’s function handling system.\\n\\n12.2.1 The load Directive\\nObjects are loaded into GNU make by placing the load directive into your makefile. The\\nsyntax of the load directive is as follows:\\n\\nload object-file ...\\n\\nor:\\n\\nload object-file(symbol-name) ...\\n\\nThe file object-file is dynamically loaded by GNU make. If object-file does not include\\na directory path then it is first looked for in the current directory. If it is not found there,\\nor a directory path is included, then system-specific paths will be searched. If the load fails\\nfor any reason, make will print a message and exit.\\n\\nIf the load succeeds make will invoke an initializing function.\\n\\nIf symbol-name is provided, it will be used as the name of the initializing function.\\n\\nIf no symbol-name is provided, the initializing function name is created by taking the\\nbase file name of object-file, up to the first character which is not a valid symbol name\\ncharacter (alphanumerics and underscores are valid symbol name characters). To this prefix\\nwill be appended the suffix _gmk_setup.\\n\\nMore than one object file may be loaded with a single load directive, and both forms of\\n\\nload arguments may be used in the same directive.\\n\\nThe initializing function will be provided the file name and line number of the invocation\\nof the load operation. It should return a value of type int, which must be 0 on failure and\\nnon-0 on success. If the return value is -1, then GNU Make will not attempt to rebuild the\\nobject file (see Section 12.2.2 [How Loaded Objects Are Remade], page 147).\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nload ../mk_funcs.so\\n\\nwill load the dynamic object ../mk_funcs.so. After the object is loaded, make will\\n\\ninvoke the function (assumed to be defined by the shared object) mk_funcs_gmk_setup.\\n\\nOn the other hand:\\n\\nload ../mk_funcs.so(init_mk_func)\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 12: Extending GNU make\\n\\n147\\n\\nwill load the dynamic object ../mk_funcs.so. After the object is loaded, make will\\n\\ninvoke the function init_mk_func.\\n\\nRegardless of how many times an object file appears in a load directive, it will only be\\n\\nloaded (and its setup function will only be invoked) once.\\n\\nAfter an object has been successfully loaded, its file name is appended to the .LOADED\\n\\nvariable.\\n\\nIf you would prefer that failure to load a dynamic object not be reported as an error,\\nyou can use the -load directive instead of load. GNU make will not fail and no message\\nwill be generated if an object fails to load. The failed object is not added to the .LOADED\\nvariable, which can then be consulted to determine if the load was successful.\\n\\n12.2.2 How Loaded Objects Are Remade\\nLoaded objects undergo the same re-make procedure as makefiles (see Section 3.5 [How\\nMakefiles Are Remade], page 15). If any loaded object is recreated, then make will start\\nfrom scratch and re-read all the makefiles, and reload the object files again.\\nIt is not\\nnecessary for the loaded object to do anything special to support this.\\n\\nIt’s up to the makefile author to provide the rules needed for rebuilding the loaded object.\\n\\n12.2.3 Loaded Object Interface\\n(cid:11)\\n\\nWarning: For this feature to be useful your extensions will need to invoke var-\\nious functions internal to GNU make. The programming interfaces provided in\\nthis release should not be considered stable: functions may be added, removed,\\nor change calling signatures or implementations in future versions of GNU make.\\n\\n(cid:10)\\n\\nTo be useful, loaded objects must be able to interact with GNU make. This interaction\\nincludes both interfaces the loaded object provides to makefiles and also interfaces make\\nprovides to the loaded object to manipulate make’s operation.\\n\\nThe interface between loaded objects and make is defined by the gnumake.h C header\\nfile. All loaded objects written in C should include this header file. Any loaded object not\\nwritten in C will need to implement the interface defined in this header file.\\n\\nTypically, a loaded object will register one or more new GNU make functions using the\\ngmk_add_function routine from within its setup function. The implementations of these\\nmake functions may make use of the gmk_expand and gmk_eval routines to perform their\\ntasks, then optionally return a string as the result of the function expansion.\\n\\nLoaded Object Licensing\\nEvery dynamic extension should define the global symbol plugin_is_GPL_compatible to\\nassert that it has been licensed under a GPL-compatible license. If this symbol does not\\nexist, make emits a fatal error and exits when it tries to load your extension.\\n\\nThe declared type of the symbol should be int.\\n\\nIt does not need to be in any allo-\\ncated section, though. The code merely asserts that the symbol exists in the global scope.\\nSomething like this is enough:\\n\\nint plugin_is_GPL_compatible;\\n\\n(cid:8)\\n\\n(cid:9)\\n\\n\\x0c148\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nData Structures\\n\\ngmk_floc This structure represents a filename/location pair. It is provided when defining\\nitems, so GNU make can inform the user later where the definition occurred if\\nnecessary.\\n\\nRegistering Functions\\nThere is currently one way for makefiles to invoke operations provided by the loaded object:\\nthrough the make function call interface. A loaded object can register one or more new\\nfunctions which may then be invoked from within the makefile in the same way as any\\nother function.\\n\\nUse gmk_add_function to create a new make function. Its arguments are as follows:\\n\\nname\\n\\nThe function name. This is what the makefile should use to invoke the function.\\nThe name must be between 1 and 255 characters long and it may only contain\\nalphanumeric, period (‘.’), dash (‘-’), and underscore (‘_’) characters. It may\\nnot begin with a period.\\n\\nfunc_ptr A pointer to a function that make will invoke when it expands the function in\\n\\na makefile. This function must be defined by the loaded object.\\n\\nmin_args The minimum number of arguments the function will accept. Must be between\\n0 and 255. GNU make will check this and fail before invoking func_ptr if the\\nfunction was invoked with too few arguments.\\n\\nmax_args The maximum number of arguments the function will accept. Must be between\\n0 and 255. GNU make will check this and fail before invoking func_ptr if the\\nIf the value is 0, then any\\nfunction was invoked with too many arguments.\\nnumber of arguments is accepted. If the value is greater than 0, then it must\\nbe greater than or equal to min_args.\\n\\nflags\\n\\nFlags that specify how this function will operate; the desired flags should be\\nOR’d together. If the GMK_FUNC_NOEXPAND flag is given then the function ar-\\nguments will not be expanded before the function is called; otherwise they will\\nbe expanded first.\\n\\nRegistered Function Interface\\nA function registered with make must match the gmk_func_ptr type. It will be invoked\\nwith three parameters: name (the name of the function), argc (the number of arguments\\nto the function), and argv (an array of pointers to arguments to the function). The last\\npointer (that is, argv[argc]) will be null (0).\\n\\nThe return value of the function is the result of expanding the function. If the function\\nexpands to nothing the return value may be null. Otherwise, it must be a pointer to a\\nstring created with gmk_alloc. Once the function returns, make owns this string and will\\nfree it when appropriate; it cannot be accessed by the loaded object.\\n\\nGNU make Facilities\\nThere are some facilities exported by GNU make for use by loaded objects. Typically these\\nwould be run from within the setup function and/or the functions registered via gmk_add_\\nfunction, to retrieve or modify the data make works with.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 12: Extending GNU make\\n\\n149\\n\\ngmk_expand\\n\\nThis function takes a string and expands it using make expansion rules. The\\nresult of the expansion is returned in a nil-terminated string buffer. The caller\\nis responsible for calling gmk_free with a pointer to the returned buffer when\\ndone.\\n\\ngmk_eval This function takes a buffer and evaluates it as a segment of makefile syntax.\\nThis function can be used to define new variables, new rules, etc. It is equivalent\\nto using the eval make function.\\n\\nNote that there is a difference between gmk_eval and calling gmk_expand with a string\\nusing the eval function: in the latter case the string will be expanded twice; once by gmk_\\nexpand and then again by the eval function. Using gmk_eval the buffer is only expanded\\nonce, at most (as it’s read by the make parser).\\n\\nMemory Management\\nSome systems allow for different memory management schemes. Thus you should never\\npass memory that you’ve allocated directly to any make function, nor should you attempt\\nto directly free any memory returned to you by any make function. Instead, use the gmk_\\nalloc and gmk_free functions.\\n\\nIn particular, the string returned to make by a function registered using gmk_add_\\nfunction must be allocated using gmk_alloc, and the string returned from the make gmk_\\nexpand function must be freed (when no longer needed) using gmk_free.\\n\\ngmk_alloc\\n\\nReturn a pointer to a newly-allocated buffer. This function will always return\\na valid pointer; if not enough memory is available make will exit. gmk_alloc\\ndoes not initialize allocated memory.\\n\\ngmk_free Free a buffer returned to you by make. Once the gmk_free function returns the\\nstring will no longer be valid. If NULL is passed to gmk_free, no operation is\\nperformed.\\n\\n12.2.4 Example Loaded Object\\nLet’s suppose we wanted to write a new GNU make function that would create a temporary\\nfile and return its name. We would like our function to take a prefix as an argument. First\\nwe can write the function in a file mk_temp.c:\\n\\n\\x0c150\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n#include <stdlib.h>\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n#include <string.h>\\n#include <unistd.h>\\n#include <errno.h>\\n\\n#include <gnumake.h>\\n\\nint plugin_is_GPL_compatible;\\n\\nchar *\\ngen_tmpfile(const char *nm, int argc, char **argv)\\n{\\n\\nint fd;\\n\\n/* Compute the size of the filename and allocate space for it.\\nint len = strlen (argv[0]) + 6 + 1;\\nchar *buf = gmk_alloc (len);\\n\\n*/\\n\\nstrcpy (buf, argv[0]);\\nstrcat (buf, \"XXXXXX\");\\n\\nfd = mkstemp(buf);\\nif (fd >= 0)\\n\\n{\\n\\n}\\n\\n/* Don’t leak the file descriptor.\\nclose (fd);\\nreturn buf;\\n\\n*/\\n\\n/* Failure. */\\nfprintf (stderr, \"mkstemp(%s) failed: %s\\\\n\", buf, strerror (errno));\\ngmk_free (buf);\\nreturn NULL;\\n\\n}\\n\\nint\\nmk_temp_gmk_setup (const gmk_floc *floc)\\n{\\n\\nprintf (\"mk_temp plugin loaded from %s:%lu\\\\n\", floc->filenm, floc->lineno);\\n/* Register the function with make name \"mk-temp\".\\ngmk_add_function (\"mk-temp\", gen_tmpfile, 1, 1, 1);\\nreturn 1;\\n\\n*/\\n\\n}\\n\\nNext, we will write a Makefile that can build this shared object, load it, and use it:\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 12: Extending GNU make\\n\\n151\\n\\nall:\\n\\n@echo Temporary file: $(mk-temp tmpfile.)\\n\\nload mk_temp.so\\n\\nmk_temp.so: mk_temp.c\\n\\n$(CC) -shared -fPIC -o $@ $<\\n\\nOn MS-Windows, due to peculiarities of how shared objects are produced, the\\ncompiler needs to scan the import library produced when building make, typically called\\nlibgnumake-version.dll.a, where version is the version of the load object API. So\\nthe recipe to produce a shared object will look on Windows like this (assuming the API\\nversion is 1):\\n\\nmk_temp.dll: mk_temp.c\\n\\n$(CC) -shared -o $@ $< -lgnumake-1\\n\\nNow when you run make you’ll see something like:\\n\\n$ make\\nmk_temp plugin loaded from Makefile:4\\ncc -shared -fPIC -o mk_temp.so mk_temp.c\\nTemporary filename: tmpfile.A7JEwd\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c153\\n\\n13 Integrating GNU make\\n\\nGNU make is often one component in a larger system of tools, including integrated develop-\\nment environments, compiler toolchains, and others. The role of make is to start commands\\nand determine whether they succeeded or not: no special integration is needed to accom-\\nplish that. However, sometimes it is convenient to bind make more tightly with other parts\\nof the system, both higher-level (tools that invoke make) and lower-level (tools that make\\ninvokes).\\n\\n13.1 Sharing Job Slots with GNU make\\nGNU make has the ability to run multiple recipes in parallel (see Section 5.4 [Parallel\\nExecution], page 51) and to cap the total number of parallel jobs even across recursive\\ninvocations of make (see Section 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 59).\\nTools that make invokes which are also able to run multiple operations in parallel, either\\nusing multiple threads or multiple processes, can be enhanced to participate in GNU make’s\\njob management facility to ensure that the total number of active threads/processes running\\non the system does not exceed the maximum number of slots provided to GNU make.\\n\\nGNU make uses a method called the “jobserver” to control the number of active jobs\\nacross recursive invocations. The actual implementation of the jobserver varies across dif-\\nferent operating systems, but some fundamental aspects are always true.\\n\\nFirst, make will provide information necessary for accessing the jobserver through the\\nenvironment to its children, in the MAKEFLAGS environment variable. Tools which want to\\nparticipate in the jobserver protocol will need to parse this environment variable and find\\nthe word starting with --jobserver-auth=. The value of this option will describe how to\\ncommunicate with the jobserver. The interpretation of this value is described in the sections\\nbelow.\\n\\nBe aware that the MAKEFLAGS variable may contain multiple instances of the\\n\\n--jobserver-auth= option. Only the last instance is relevant.\\n\\nSecond, every command make starts has one implicit job slot reserved for it before it\\nstarts. Any tool which wants to participate in the jobserver protocol should assume it can\\nalways run one job without having to contact the jobserver at all.\\n\\nFinally, it’s critical that tools that participate in the jobserver protocol return the exact\\nnumber of slots they obtained from the jobserver back to the jobserver before they exit,\\neven under error conditions. Remember that the implicit job slot should not be returned\\nto the jobserver! Returning too few slots means that those slots will be lost for the rest of\\nthe build process; returning too many slots means that extra slots will be available. The\\ntop-level make command will print an error message at the end of the build if it detects an\\nincorrect number of slots available in the jobserver.\\n\\nAs an example, suppose you are implementing a linker which provides for multithreaded\\noperation. You would like to enhance the linker so that if it is invoked by GNU make it\\ncan participate in the jobserver protocol to control how many threads are used during link.\\nFirst you will need to modify the linker to determine if the MAKEFLAGS environment variable\\nis set. Next you will need to parse the value of that variable to determine if the jobserver\\nis available, and how to access it. If it is available then you can access it to obtain job slots\\n\\n\\x0c154\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ncontrolling how much parallelism your tool can use. Once done your tool must return those\\njob slots back to the jobserver.\\n\\n13.1.1 POSIX Jobserver Interaction\\nOn POSIX systems the jobserver is implemented in one of two ways: on systems that\\nIn this\\nsupport it, GNU make will create a named pipe and use that for the jobserver.\\ncase the auth option will have the form --jobserver-auth=fifo:PATH where ‘PATH’ is the\\npathname of the named pipe. To access the jobserver you should open the named pipe path\\nand read/write to it as described below.\\n\\nIf the system doesn’t support named pipes, or if the user provided the --jobserver-\\nstyle option and specified ‘pipe’, then the jobserver will be implemented as a simple UNIX\\npipe. In this case the auth option will have the form --jobserver-auth=R,W where ‘R’ and\\n‘W’ are non-negative integers representing file descriptors: ‘R’ is the read file descriptor and\\nIf either or both of these file descriptors are negative, it\\n‘W’ is the write file descriptor.\\nmeans the jobserver is disabled for this process.\\n\\nWhen using a simple pipe, only command lines that make understands to be recursive\\ninvocations of make (see Section 5.7.1 [How the MAKE Variable Works], page 56) will have\\naccess to the jobserver. When writing makefiles you must be sure to mark the command\\nas recursive (most commonly by prefixing the command line with the + indicator (see\\nSection 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56). Note that the read side of the jobserver pipe\\nis set to “blocking” mode. This should not be changed.\\n\\nIn both implementations of the jobserver, the pipe will be pre-loaded with one single-\\ncharacter token for each available job. To obtain an extra slot you must read a single\\ncharacter from the jobserver; to release a slot you must write a single character back into\\nthe jobserver.\\n\\nIt’s important that when you release the job slot, you write back the same character you\\nread. Don’t assume that all tokens are the same character; different characters may have\\ndifferent meanings to GNU make. The order is not important, since make has no idea in\\nwhat order jobs will complete anyway.\\n\\nThere are various error conditions you must consider to ensure your implementation is\\n\\nrobust:\\n\\n• If you have a command-line argument controlling the parallel operation of your tool,\\nconsider whether your tool should detect situations where both the jobserver and the\\ncommand-line argument are specified, and how it should react.\\n\\n• If your tool does not recognize the format of the --jobserver-auth string, it should\\n\\nassume the jobserver is using a different style and it cannot connect.\\n\\n• If your tool determines that the --jobserver-auth option references a simple pipe but\\nthat the file descriptors specified are closed, this means that the calling make process\\ndid not think that your tool was a recursive make invocation (e.g., the command line\\nwas not prefixed with a + character). You should notify your users of this situation.\\n\\n• Your tool should be sure to write back the tokens it read, even under error conditions.\\nThis includes not only errors in your tool but also outside influences such as interrupts\\n(SIGINT), etc. You may want to install signal handlers to manage this write-back.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 13: Integrating GNU make\\n\\n155\\n\\n• Your tool may also examine the first word of the MAKEFLAGS variable and look for the\\ncharacter n. If this character is present then make was invoked with the ‘-n’ option\\nand your tool may want to stop without performing any operations.\\n\\n13.1.2 Windows Jobserver Interaction\\nOn Windows systems the jobserver is implemented as a named semaphore. The semaphore\\nwill be set with an initial count equal to the number of available slots; to obtain a slot you\\nmust wait on the semaphore (with or without a timeout). To release a slot, release the\\nsemaphore.\\n\\nTo access the semaphore you must parse the MAKEFLAGS variable and look for the argu-\\nment string --jobserver-auth=NAME where ‘NAME’ is the name of the named semaphore.\\nUse this name with OpenSemaphore to create a handle to the semaphore.\\n\\nThe only valid style for --jobserver-style is ‘sem’.\\n\\nThere are various error conditions you must consider to ensure your implementation is\\n\\nrobust:\\n\\n• Usually you will have a command-line argument controlling the parallel operation of\\nyour tool. Consider whether your tool should detect situations where both the jobserver\\nand the command-line argument are specified, and how it should react.\\n\\n• Your tool should be sure to release the semaphore for the tokens it read, even under\\nerror conditions. This includes not only errors in your tool but also outside influences\\nsuch as interrupts (SIGINT), etc. You may want to install signal handlers to manage\\nthis write-back.\\n\\n13.2 Synchronized Terminal Output\\n\\nNormally GNU make will invoke all commands with access to the same standard and error\\noutputs that make itself was started with. A number of tools will detect whether the output\\nis a terminal or not-a-terminal, and use this information to change the output style. For\\nexample if the output goes to a terminal the tool may add control characters that set color,\\nor even change the location of the cursor. If the output is not going to a terminal then\\nthese special control characters are not emitted so that they don’t corrupt log files, etc.\\n\\nThe --output-sync (see Section 5.4.2 [Output During Parallel Execution], page 53)\\noption will defeat the terminal detection. When output synchronization is enabled GNU\\nmake arranges for all command output to be written to a file, so that its output can be\\nwritten as a block without interference from other commands. This means that all tools\\ninvoked by make will believe that their output is not going to be displayed on a terminal,\\neven when it will be (because make will display it there after the command is completed).\\n\\nIn order to facilitate tools which would like to determine whether or not their output\\nwill be displayed on a terminal, GNU make will set the MAKE_TERMOUT and MAKE_TERMERR\\nenvironment variables before invoking any commands. Tools which would like to determine\\nwhether standard or error output (respectively) will be displayed on a terminal can check\\nthese environment variables to determine if they exist and contain a non-empty value. If\\nso the tool can assume that the output will (eventually) be displayed on a terminal. If the\\nvariables are not set or have an empty value, then the tool should fall back to its normal\\nmethods of detecting whether output is going to a terminal or not.\\n\\n\\x0c156\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nThe content of the variables can be parsed to determine the type of terminal which will\\n\\nbe used to display the output.\\n\\nSimilarly, environments which invoke make and would like to capture the output and\\neventually display it on a terminal (or some display which can interpret terminal control\\ncharacters) can set these variables before invoking make. GNU make will not modify these\\nenvironment variables if they already exist when it starts.\\n\\n\\x0c157\\n\\n14 Features of GNU make\\n\\nHere is a summary of the features of GNU make, for comparison with and credit to other\\nversions of make. We consider the features of make in 4.2 BSD systems as a baseline. If\\nyou are concerned with writing portable makefiles, you should not use the features of make\\nlisted here, nor the ones in Chapter 15 [Missing], page 161.\\n\\nMany features come from the version of make in System V.\\n\\n• The VPATH variable and its special meaning. See Section 4.4 [Searching Directories for\\nPrerequisites], page 27. This feature exists in System V make, but is undocumented.\\nIt is documented in 4.3 BSD make (which says it mimics System V’s VPATH feature).\\n• Included makefiles. See Section 3.3 [Including Other Makefiles], page 13. Allowing\\n\\nmultiple files to be included with a single directive is a GNU extension.\\n\\n• Variables are read from and communicated via the environment. See Section 6.10\\n\\n[Variables from the Environment], page 77.\\n\\n• Options passed through the variable MAKEFLAGS to recursive invocations of make. See\\n\\nSection 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 59.\\n\\n• The automatic variable $% is set to the member name in an archive reference. See\\n\\nSection 10.5.3 [Automatic Variables], page 130.\\n\\n• The automatic variables $@, $*, $<, $%, and $? have corresponding forms like $(@F)\\nand $(@D). We have generalized this to $^ as an obvious extension. See Section 10.5.3\\n[Automatic Variables], page 130.\\n• Substitution variable references.\\n\\nSee Section 6.1 [Basics of Variable References],\\n\\npage 65.\\n\\n• The command line options ‘-b’ and ‘-m’, accepted and ignored. In System V make,\\n\\nthese options actually do something.\\n\\n• Execution of recursive commands to run make via the variable MAKE even if ‘-n’, ‘-q’\\n\\nor ‘-t’ is specified. See Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56.\\n\\n• Support for suffix ‘.a’ in suffix rules. See Section 11.4 [Archive Suffix Rules], page 141.\\nThis feature is obsolete in GNU make, because the general feature of rule chaining (see\\nSection 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127) allows one pattern rule for installing\\nmembers in an archive (see Section 11.2 [Archive Update], page 139) to be sufficient.\\n• The arrangement of lines and backslash/newline combinations in recipes is retained\\nwhen the recipes are printed, so they appear as they do in the makefile, except for the\\nstripping of initial whitespace.\\n\\nThe following features were inspired by various other versions of make. In some cases it\\n\\nis unclear exactly which versions inspired which others.\\n\\n• Pattern rules using ‘%’. This has been implemented in several versions of make. We’re\\nnot sure who invented it first, but it’s been spread around a bit. See Section 10.5\\n[Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules], page 129.\\n\\n• Rule chaining and implicit intermediate files. This was implemented by Stu Feldman\\nin his version of make for AT&T Eighth Edition Research Unix, and later by Andrew\\nHume of AT&T Bell Labs in his mk program (where he terms it “transitive closure”).\\nWe do not really know if we got this from either of them or thought it up ourselves at\\nthe same time. See Section 10.4 [Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\n\\x0c158\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n• The automatic variable $^ containing a list of all prerequisites of the current target.\\nWe did not invent this, but we have no idea who did. See Section 10.5.3 [Automatic\\nVariables], page 130. The automatic variable $+ is a simple extension of $^.\\n\\n• The “what if” flag (‘-W’ in GNU make) was (as far as we know) invented by Andrew\\n\\nHume in mk. See Section 9.3 [Instead of Executing Recipes], page 111.\\n\\n• The concept of doing several things at once (parallelism) exists in many incarnations\\nof make and similar programs, though not in the System V or BSD implementations.\\nSee Section 5.3 [Recipe Execution], page 48.\\n\\n• A number of different build tools that support parallelism also support collecting output\\nand displaying as a single block. See Section 5.4.2 [Output During Parallel Execution],\\npage 53.\\n\\n• Modified variable references using pattern substitution come from SunOS 4. See\\nSection 6.1 [Basics of Variable References], page 65. This functionality was provided in\\nGNU make by the patsubst function before the alternate syntax was implemented for\\ncompatibility with SunOS 4. It is not altogether clear who inspired whom, since GNU\\nmake had patsubst before SunOS 4 was released.\\n\\n• The special significance of ‘+’ characters preceding recipe lines (see Section 9.3 [In-\\nstead of Executing Recipes], page 111) is mandated by IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992\\n(POSIX.2).\\n\\n• The ‘+=’ syntax to append to the value of a variable comes from SunOS 4 make. See\\n\\nSection 6.6 [Appending More Text to Variables], page 74.\\n\\n• The syntax ‘archive(mem1 mem2...)’ to list multiple members in a single archive file\\n\\ncomes from SunOS 4 make. See Section 11.1 [Archive Members], page 139.\\n\\n• The -include directive to include makefiles with no error for a nonexistent file comes\\nfrom SunOS 4 make. (But note that SunOS 4 make does not allow multiple makefiles\\nto be specified in one -include directive.) The same feature appears with the name\\nsinclude in SGI make and perhaps others.\\n\\n• The != shell assignment operator exists in many BSD of make and is purposefully\\n\\nimplemented here to behave identically to those implementations.\\n\\n• Various build management tools are implemented using scripting languages such as\\nPerl or Python and thus provide a natural embedded scripting language, similar to\\nGNU make’s integration of GNU Guile.\\n\\nThe remaining features are inventions new in GNU make:\\n\\n• Use the ‘-v’ or ‘--version’ option to print version and copyright information.\\n• Use the ‘-h’ or ‘--help’ option to summarize the options to make.\\n• Simply-expanded variables. See Section 6.2 [The Two Flavors of Variables], page 66.\\n\\n• Pass command line variable assignments automatically through the variable MAKE to\\n\\nrecursive make invocations. See Section 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56.\\n\\n• Use the ‘-C’ or ‘--directory’ command option to change directory. See Section 9.8\\n\\n[Summary of Options], page 114.\\n\\n• Make verbatim variable definitions with define. See Section 6.8 [Defining Multi-Line\\n\\nVariables], page 76.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 14: Features of GNU make\\n\\n159\\n\\n• Declare phony targets with the special target .PHONY.\\n\\nAndrew Hume of AT&T Bell Labs implemented a similar feature with a different syntax\\nin his mk program. This seems to be a case of parallel discovery. See Section 4.5 [Phony\\nTargets], page 31.\\n\\n• Manipulate text by calling functions. See Chapter 8 [Functions for Transforming Text],\\n\\npage 91.\\n\\n• Use the ‘-o’ or ‘--old-file’ option to pretend a file’s modification-time is old. See\\n\\nSection 9.4 [Avoiding Recompilation of Some Files], page 112.\\n\\n• Conditional execution.\\n\\nThis feature has been implemented numerous times in various versions of make; it seems\\na natural extension derived from the features of the C preprocessor and similar macro\\nlanguages and is not a revolutionary concept. See Chapter 7 [Conditional Parts of\\nMakefiles], page 85.\\n\\n• Specify a search path for included makefiles. See Section 3.3 [Including Other Make-\\n\\nfiles], page 13.\\n\\n• Specify extra makefiles to read with an environment variable. See Section 3.4 [The\\n\\nVariable MAKEFILES], page 14.\\n\\n• Strip leading sequences of ‘./’ from file names, so that ./file and file are considered\\n\\nto be the same file.\\n\\n• Use a special search method for library prerequisites written in the form ‘-lname’. See\\n\\nSection 4.4.6 [Directory Search for Link Libraries], page 30.\\n\\n• Allow suffixes for suffix rules (see Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules], page 136)\\nto contain any characters. In other versions of make, they must begin with ‘.’ and not\\ncontain any ‘/’ characters.\\n\\n• Keep track of the current level of make recursion using the variable MAKELEVEL. See\\n\\nSection 5.7 [Recursive Use of make], page 56.\\n\\n• Provide any goals given on the command line in the variable MAKECMDGOALS. See\\n\\nSection 9.2 [Arguments to Specify the Goals], page 109.\\n\\n• Specify static pattern rules. See Section 4.11 [Static Pattern Rules], page 40.\\n• Provide selective vpath search. See Section 4.4 [Searching Directories for Prerequisites],\\n\\npage 27.\\n\\n• Provide computed variable references. See Section 6.1 [Basics of Variable References],\\n\\npage 65.\\n\\n• Update makefiles. See Section 3.5 [How Makefiles Are Remade], page 15. System V\\nmake has a very, very limited form of this functionality in that it will check out SCCS\\nfiles for makefiles.\\n\\n• Various new built-in implicit rules. See Section 10.2 [Catalogue of Built-In Rules],\\n\\npage 122.\\n\\n• Load dynamic objects which can modify the behavior of make. See Section 12.2 [Loading\\n\\nDynamic Objects], page 145.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c161\\n\\n15 Incompatibilities and Missing Features\\n\\nThe make programs in various other systems support a few features that are not implemented\\nin GNU make. The POSIX.2 standard (IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992) which specifies make\\ndoes not require any of these features.\\n\\n• A target of the form ‘file((entry))’ stands for a member of archive file file. The\\nmember is chosen, not by name, but by being an object file which defines the linker\\nsymbol entry.\\n\\nThis feature was not put into GNU make because of the non-modularity of putting\\nknowledge into make of the internal\\nSee\\nSection 11.2.1 [Updating Archive Symbol Directories], page 140.\\n\\nformat of archive file symbol tables.\\n\\n• Suffixes (used in suffix rules) that end with the character ‘~’ have a special meaning to\\nSystem V make; they refer to the SCCS file that corresponds to the file one would get\\nwithout the ‘~’. For example, the suffix rule ‘.c~.o’ would make the file n.o from the\\nSCCS file s.n.c. For complete coverage, a whole series of such suffix rules is required.\\nSee Section 10.7 [Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules], page 136.\\n\\nIn GNU make, this entire series of cases is handled by two pattern rules for extraction\\nfrom SCCS, in combination with the general feature of rule chaining. See Section 10.4\\n[Chains of Implicit Rules], page 127.\\n\\n• In System V and 4.3 BSD make, files found by VPATH search (see Section 4.4 [Searching\\nDirectories for Prerequisites], page 27) have their names changed inside recipes. We\\nfeel it is much cleaner to always use automatic variables and thus make this feature\\nunnecessary.\\n\\n• In some Unix makes, the automatic variable $* appearing in the prerequisites of a rule\\nhas the amazingly strange “feature” of expanding to the full name of the target of that\\nrule. We cannot imagine what went on in the minds of Unix make developers to do\\nthis; it is utterly inconsistent with the normal definition of $*.\\n\\n• In some Unix makes,\\n\\nimplicit rule search (see Chapter 10 [Using Implicit Rules],\\npage 121) is apparently done for all targets, not just those without recipes. This\\nmeans you can do:\\n\\nfoo.o:\\n\\ncc -c foo.c\\n\\nand Unix make will intuit that foo.o depends on foo.c.\\n\\nWe feel that such usage is broken. The prerequisite properties of make are well-defined\\n(for GNU make, at least), and doing such a thing simply does not fit the model.\\n\\n• GNU make does not include any built-in implicit rules for compiling or preprocessing\\n\\nEFL programs. If we hear of anyone who is using EFL, we will gladly add them.\\n\\n• It appears that in SVR4 make, a suffix rule can be specified with no recipe, and it is\\ntreated as if it had an empty recipe (see Section 5.9 [Empty Recipes], page 62). For\\nexample:\\n\\n.c.a:\\n\\nwill override the built-in .c.a suffix rule.\\n\\n\\x0c162\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nWe feel that it is cleaner for a rule without a recipe to always simply add to the\\nprerequisite list for the target. The above example can be easily rewritten to get the\\ndesired behavior in GNU make:\\n\\n.c.a: ;\\n\\n• Some versions of make invoke the shell with the ‘-e’ flag, except under ‘-k’ (see\\nSection 9.6 [Testing the Compilation of a Program], page 114). The ‘-e’ flag tells\\nthe shell to exit as soon as any program it runs returns a nonzero status. We feel it is\\ncleaner to write each line of the recipe to stand on its own and not require this special\\ntreatment.\\n\\n\\x0c163\\n\\n16 Makefile Conventions\\n\\nThis chapter describes conventions for writing the Makefiles for GNU programs. Using Au-\\ntomake will help you write a Makefile that follows these conventions. For more information\\non portable Makefiles, see posix and Section “Portable Make” in Autoconf .\\n\\n16.1 General Conventions for Makefiles\\n\\nEvery Makefile should contain this line:\\n\\nSHELL = /bin/sh\\n\\nto avoid trouble on systems where the SHELL variable might be inherited from the environ-\\nment. (This is never a problem with GNU make.)\\n\\nDifferent make programs have incompatible suffix lists and implicit rules, and this some-\\ntimes creates confusion or misbehavior. So it is a good idea to set the suffix list explicitly\\nusing only the suffixes you need in the particular Makefile, like this:\\n\\n.SUFFIXES:\\n.SUFFIXES: .c .o\\n\\nThe first line clears out the suffix list, the second introduces all suffixes which may be\\nsubject to implicit rules in this Makefile.\\n\\nDon’t assume that . is in the path for command execution. When you need to run\\nprograms that are a part of your package during the make, please make sure that it uses ./\\nif the program is built as part of the make or $(srcdir)/ if the file is an unchanging part\\nof the source code. Without one of these prefixes, the current search path is used.\\n\\nThe distinction between ./ (the build directory) and $(srcdir)/ (the source directory)\\nis important because users can build in a separate directory using the ‘--srcdir’ option to\\nconfigure. A rule of the form:\\nfoo.1 : foo.man sedscript\\n\\nsed -f sedscript foo.man > foo.1\\n\\nwill fail when the build directory is not the source directory, because foo.man and sedscript\\nare in the source directory.\\n\\nWhen using GNU make, relying on ‘VPATH’ to find the source file will work in the case\\nwhere there is a single dependency file, since the make automatic variable ‘$<’ will represent\\nthe source file wherever it is. (Many versions of make set ‘$<’ only in implicit rules.) A\\nMakefile target like\\nfoo.o : bar.c\\n\\n$(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c bar.c -o foo.o\\n\\nshould instead be written as\\n\\nfoo.o : bar.c\\n\\n$(CC) -I. -I$(srcdir) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@\\n\\nin order to allow ‘VPATH’ to work correctly. When the target has multiple dependencies,\\nusing an explicit ‘$(srcdir)’ is the easiest way to make the rule work well. For example,\\nthe target above for foo.1 is best written as:\\n\\nfoo.1 : foo.man sedscript\\n\\nsed -f $(srcdir)/sedscript $(srcdir)/foo.man > $@\\n\\nGNU distributions usually contain some files which are not source files—for example, Info\\nfiles, and the output from Autoconf, Automake, Bison or Flex. Since these files normally\\n\\n\\x0c164\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nappear in the source directory, they should always appear in the source directory, not in\\nthe build directory. So Makefile rules to update them should put the updated files in the\\nsource directory.\\n\\nHowever, if a file does not appear in the distribution, then the Makefile should not put\\nit in the source directory, because building a program in ordinary circumstances should not\\nmodify the source directory in any way.\\n\\nTry to make the build and installation targets, at least (and all their subtargets) work\\n\\ncorrectly with a parallel make.\\n\\n16.2 Utilities in Makefiles\\n\\nWrite the Makefile commands (and any shell scripts, such as configure) to run under sh\\n(both the traditional Bourne shell and the posix shell), not csh. Don’t use any special\\nfeatures of ksh or bash, or posix features not widely supported in traditional Bourne sh.\\nThe configure script and the Makefile rules for building and installation should not use\\n\\nany utilities directly except these:\\n\\nawk cat cmp cp diff echo expr false grep install-info ln ls\\nmkdir mv printf pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch tr true\\n\\nCompression programs such as gzip can be used in the dist rule.\\nGenerally, stick to the widely-supported (usually posix-specified) options and features\\nof these programs. For example, don’t use ‘mkdir -p’, convenient as it may be, because a\\nfew systems don’t support it at all and with others, it is not safe for parallel execution. For\\na list of known incompatibilities, see Section “Portable Shell” in Autoconf .\\n\\nIt is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles, since a few file systems\\n\\ndon’t support them.\\n\\nThe Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers and related pro-\\ngrams, but should do so via make variables so that the user can substitute alternatives.\\nHere are some of the programs we mean:\\n\\nar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex\\nmake makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc\\n\\nUse the following make variables to run those programs:\\n\\n$(AR) $(BISON) $(CC) $(FLEX) $(INSTALL) $(LD) $(LDCONFIG) $(LEX)\\n$(MAKE) $(MAKEINFO) $(RANLIB) $(TEXI2DVI) $(YACC)\\n\\nWhen you use ranlib or ldconfig, you should make sure nothing bad happens if the\\nsystem does not have the program in question. Arrange to ignore an error from that\\ncommand, and print a message before the command to tell the user that failure of this\\ncommand does not mean a problem.\\n(The Autoconf ‘AC_PROG_RANLIB’ macro can help\\nwith this.)\\n\\nIf you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for systems that don’t have\\n\\nsymbolic links.\\n\\nAdditional utilities that can be used via Make variables are:\\n\\nchgrp chmod chown mknod\\n\\nIt is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts) intended only for particular\\n\\nsystems where you know those utilities exist.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n165\\n\\n16.3 Variables for Specifying Commands\\n\\nMakefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands, options, and so on.\\n\\nIn particular, you should run most utility programs via variables. Thus, if you use Bison,\\nhave a variable named BISON whose default value is set with ‘BISON = bison’, and refer to\\nit with $(BISON) whenever you need to use Bison.\\n\\nFile management utilities such as ln, rm, mv, and so on, need not be referred to through\\n\\nvariables in this way, since users don’t need to replace them with other programs.\\n\\nEach program-name variable should come with an options variable that is used to supply\\noptions to the program. Append ‘FLAGS’ to the program-name variable name to get the\\noptions variable name—for example, BISONFLAGS. (The names CFLAGS for the C compiler,\\nYFLAGS for yacc, and LFLAGS for lex, are exceptions to this rule, but we keep them because\\nthey are standard.) Use CPPFLAGS in any compilation command that runs the preprocessor,\\nand use LDFLAGS in any compilation command that does linking as well as in any direct use\\nof ld.\\n\\nIf there are C compiler options that must be used for proper compilation of certain files,\\ndo not include them in CFLAGS. Users expect to be able to specify CFLAGS freely themselves.\\nInstead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler independently of CFLAGS,\\nby writing them explicitly in the compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like\\nthis:\\n\\nCFLAGS = -g\\nALL_CFLAGS = -I. $(CFLAGS)\\n.c.o:\\n\\n$(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $<\\n\\nDo include the ‘-g’ option in CFLAGS, because that is not required for proper compilation.\\nYou can consider it a default that is only recommended. If the package is set up so that it\\nis compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include ‘-O’ in the default value\\nof CFLAGS as well.\\n\\nPut CFLAGS last in the compilation command, after other variables containing compiler\\n\\noptions, so the user can use CFLAGS to override the others.\\n\\nCFLAGS should be used in every invocation of the C compiler, both those which do\\n\\ncompilation and those which do linking.\\n\\nEvery Makefile should define the variable INSTALL, which is the basic command for\\n\\ninstalling a file into the system.\\n\\nEvery Makefile should also define the variables INSTALL_PROGRAM and INSTALL_DATA.\\n(The default for INSTALL_PROGRAM should be $(INSTALL); the default for INSTALL_DATA\\nshould be ${INSTALL} -m 644.) Then it should use those variables as the commands for\\nactual installation, for executables and non-executables respectively. Minimal use of these\\nvariables is as follows:\\n\\n$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo\\n$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a\\n\\nHowever, it is preferable to support a DESTDIR prefix on the target files, as explained in\\n\\nthe next section.\\n\\nIt is acceptable, but not required, to install multiple files in one command, with the final\\n\\nargument being a directory, as in:\\n\\n$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo bar baz $(bindir)\\n\\n\\x0c166\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n16.4 DESTDIR: Support for Staged Installs\\nDESTDIR is a variable prepended to each installed target file, like this:\\n\\n$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/foo\\n$(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(DESTDIR)$(libdir)/libfoo.a\\n\\nThe DESTDIR variable is specified by the user on the make command line as an absolute\\n\\nfile name. For example:\\n\\nmake DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install\\n\\nDESTDIR should be supported only in the install* and uninstall* targets, as those are\\nthe only targets where it is useful.\\n\\nIf your installation step would normally install /usr/local/bin/foo and /usr/\\nlocal/lib/libfoo.a, then an installation invoked as in the example above would install\\n/tmp/stage/usr/local/bin/foo and /tmp/stage/usr/local/lib/libfoo.a instead.\\n\\nPrepending the variable DESTDIR to each target in this way provides for staged installs,\\nwhere the installed files are not placed directly into their expected location but are instead\\ncopied into a temporary location (DESTDIR). However, installed files maintain their relative\\ndirectory structure and any embedded file names will not be modified.\\n\\nYou should not set the value of DESTDIR in your Makefile at all; then the files are\\ninstalled into their expected locations by default. Also, specifying DESTDIR should not\\nchange the operation of the software in any way, so its value should not be included in any\\nfile contents.\\n\\nDESTDIR support is commonly used in package creation. It is also helpful to users who\\nwant to understand what a given package will install where, and to allow users who don’t\\nnormally have permissions to install into protected areas to build and install before gaining\\nthose permissions. Finally, it can be useful with tools such as stow, where code is installed\\nin one place but made to appear to be installed somewhere else using symbolic links or\\nspecial mount operations. So, we strongly recommend GNU packages support DESTDIR,\\nthough it is not an absolute requirement.\\n\\n16.5 Variables for Installation Directories\\n\\nInstallation directories should always be named by variables, so it is easy to install in a\\nnonstandard place. The standard names for these variables and the values they should\\nhave in GNU packages are described below. They are based on a standard file system\\nlayout; variants of it are used in GNU/Linux and other modern operating systems.\\n\\nInstallers are expected to override these values when calling make (e.g., make\\nprefix=/usr install) or configure (e.g., configure --prefix=/usr). GNU packages\\nshould not try to guess which value should be appropriate for these variables on the\\nsystem they are being installed onto: use the default settings specified here so that all\\nGNU packages behave identically, allowing the installer to achieve any desired layout.\\n\\nAll installation directories, and their parent directories, should be created (if necessary)\\n\\nbefore they are installed into.\\n\\nThese first two variables set the root for the installation. All the other installation\\ndirectories should be subdirectories of one of these two, and nothing should be directly\\ninstalled into these two directories.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n167\\n\\nprefix\\n\\nA prefix used in constructing the default values of the variables listed below.\\nThe default value of prefix should be /usr/local. When building the com-\\nplete GNU system, the prefix will be empty and /usr will be a symbolic link\\nto /. (If you are using Autoconf, write it as ‘@prefix@’.)\\nRunning ‘make install’ with a different value of prefix from the one used to\\nbuild the program should not recompile the program.\\n\\nexec_prefix\\n\\nA prefix used in constructing the default values of some of the variables listed\\nbelow. The default value of exec_prefix should be $(prefix). (If you are\\nusing Autoconf, write it as ‘@exec_prefix@’.)\\nGenerally, $(exec_prefix) is used for directories that contain machine-specific\\nfiles (such as executables and subroutine libraries), while $(prefix) is used\\ndirectly for other directories.\\nRunning ‘make install’ with a different value of exec_prefix from the one\\nused to build the program should not recompile the program.\\n\\nExecutable programs are installed in one of the following directories.\\n\\nbindir\\n\\nsbindir\\n\\nThe directory for installing executable programs that users can run. This should\\nnormally be /usr/local/bin, but write it as $(exec_prefix)/bin. (If you are\\nusing Autoconf, write it as ‘@bindir@’.)\\n\\nThe directory for installing executable programs that can be run from the shell,\\nbut are only generally useful to system administrators. This should normally\\nbe /usr/local/sbin, but write it as $(exec_prefix)/sbin. (If you are using\\nAutoconf, write it as ‘@sbindir@’.)\\n\\nlibexecdir\\n\\nThe directory for installing executable programs to be run by other programs\\nrather than by users. This directory should normally be /usr/local/libexec,\\nbut write it as $(exec_prefix)/libexec. (If you are using Autoconf, write it\\nas ‘@libexecdir@’.)\\nThe definition of ‘libexecdir’ is the same for all packages, so you should\\ninstall your data in a subdirectory thereof. Most packages install their data un-\\nder $(libexecdir)/package-name/, possibly within additional subdirectories\\nthereof, such as $(libexecdir)/package-name/machine/version.\\n\\nData files used by the program during its execution are divided into categories in two\\n\\nways.\\n\\n• Some files are normally modified by programs; others are never normally modified\\n\\n(though users may edit some of these).\\n\\n• Some files are architecture-independent and can be shared by all machines at a site;\\nsome are architecture-dependent and can be shared only by machines of the same kind\\nand operating system; others may never be shared between two machines.\\n\\nThis makes for six different possibilities. However, we want to discourage the use of\\nIt is much cleaner to\\n\\narchitecture-dependent files, aside from object files and libraries.\\nmake other data files architecture-independent, and it is generally not hard.\\n\\n\\x0c168\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nHere are the variables Makefiles should use to specify directories to put these various\\n\\nkinds of files in:\\n\\n‘datarootdir’\\n\\nThe root of the directory tree for read-only architecture-independent data files.\\nThis should normally be /usr/local/share, but write it as $(prefix)/share.\\n(If you are using Autoconf, write it as ‘@datarootdir@’.) ‘datadir’’s default\\nvalue is based on this variable; so are ‘infodir’, ‘mandir’, and others.\\n\\n‘datadir’ The directory for installing idiosyncratic read-only architecture-independent\\ndata files for this program. This is usually the same place as ‘datarootdir’,\\nbut we use the two separate variables so that you can move these program-\\nspecific files without altering the location for Info files, man pages, etc.\\nThis should normally be /usr/local/share, but write it as $(datarootdir).\\n(If you are using Autoconf, write it as ‘@datadir@’.)\\nThe definition of ‘datadir’ is the same for all packages, so you should install\\nyour data in a subdirectory thereof. Most packages install their data under\\n$(datadir)/package-name/.\\n\\n‘sysconfdir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing read-only data files that pertain to a single machine–\\nthat is to say, files for configuring a host. Mailer and network configura-\\ntion files, /etc/passwd, and so forth belong here. All the files in this direc-\\ntory should be ordinary ASCII text files. This directory should normally be\\n/usr/local/etc, but write it as $(prefix)/etc. (If you are using Autoconf,\\nwrite it as ‘@sysconfdir@’.)\\nDo not install executables here in this directory (they probably belong in\\n$(libexecdir) or $(sbindir)). Also do not install files that are modified in\\nthe normal course of their use (programs whose purpose is to change the config-\\nuration of the system excluded). Those probably belong in $(localstatedir).\\n\\n‘sharedstatedir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing architecture-independent data files which the\\nprograms modify while they run. This should normally be /usr/local/com,\\n(If you are using Autoconf, write it as\\nbut write it as $(prefix)/com.\\n‘@sharedstatedir@’.)\\n\\n‘localstatedir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing data files which the programs modify while they\\nrun, and that pertain to one specific machine. Users should never need\\nto modify files in this directory to configure the package’s operation; put\\nsuch configuration information in separate files that go in $(datadir) or\\n$(localstatedir) should normally be /usr/local/var,\\n$(sysconfdir).\\nbut write it as $(prefix)/var.\\n(If you are using Autoconf, write it as\\n‘@localstatedir@’.)\\n\\n‘runstatedir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing data files which the programs modify while they run,\\nthat pertain to one specific machine, and which need not persist longer than\\nthe execution of the program—which is generally long-lived, for example, until\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n169\\n\\nthe next reboot. PID files for system daemons are a typical use. In addition,\\nthis directory should not be cleaned except perhaps at reboot, while the general\\n/tmp (TMPDIR) may be cleaned arbitrarily. This should normally be /var/run,\\nbut write it as $(localstatedir)/run. Having it as a separate variable allows\\nthe use of /run if desired, for example. (If you are using Autoconf 2.70 or later,\\nwrite it as ‘@runstatedir@’.)\\n\\nThese variables specify the directory for installing certain specific types of files, if your\\nprogram has them. Every GNU package should have Info files, so every program needs\\n‘infodir’, but not all need ‘libdir’ or ‘lispdir’.\\n\\n‘includedir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing header files to be included by user programs\\nwith the C ‘#include’ preprocessor directive. This should normally be\\n/usr/local/include, but write it as $(prefix)/include. (If you are using\\nAutoconf, write it as ‘@includedir@’.)\\nMost compilers other than GCC do not look for header files in directory\\n/usr/local/include. So installing the header files this way is only useful\\nwith GCC. Sometimes this is not a problem because some libraries are only\\nreally intended to work with GCC. But some libraries are intended to work\\nwith other compilers. They should install their header files in two places, one\\nspecified by includedir and one specified by oldincludedir.\\n\\n‘oldincludedir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing ‘#include’ header files for use with compilers other\\nthan GCC. This should normally be /usr/include. (If you are using Autoconf,\\nyou can write it as ‘@oldincludedir@’.)\\nThe Makefile commands should check whether the value of oldincludedir is\\nempty. If it is, they should not try to use it; they should cancel the second\\ninstallation of the header files.\\n\\nA package should not replace an existing header in this directory unless the\\nheader came from the same package. Thus, if your Foo package provides a\\nheader file foo.h, then it should install the header file in the oldincludedir\\ndirectory if either (1) there is no foo.h there or (2) the foo.h that exists came\\nfrom the Foo package.\\n\\nTo tell whether foo.h came from the Foo package, put a magic string in the\\nfile—part of a comment—and grep for that string.\\n\\n‘docdir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing documentation files (other than Info) for this pack-\\nage. By default, it should be /usr/local/share/doc/yourpkg, but it should\\nbe written as $(datarootdir)/doc/yourpkg. (If you are using Autoconf, write\\nit as ‘@docdir@’.) The yourpkg subdirectory, which may include a version num-\\nber, prevents collisions among files with common names, such as README.\\n\\n‘infodir’ The directory for installing the Info files for this package. By default,\\nshould be written as\\nit\\n$(datarootdir)/info. (If you are using Autoconf, write it as ‘@infodir@’.)\\ninfodir is separate from docdir for compatibility with existing practice.\\n\\nshould be /usr/local/share/info, but\\n\\nit\\n\\n\\x0c170\\n\\n‘htmldir’\\n‘dvidir’\\n‘pdfdir’\\n‘psdir’\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nDirectories for installing documentation files in the particular format. They\\nshould all be set to $(docdir) by default.\\n(If you are using Autoconf,\\nwrite them as ‘@htmldir@’, ‘@dvidir@’, etc.) Packages which supply several\\ntranslations of their documentation should install them in ‘$(htmldir)/’ll,\\n‘$(pdfdir)/’ll, etc. where ll is a locale abbreviation such as ‘en’ or ‘pt_BR’.\\n\\n‘libdir’\\n\\nThe directory for object files and libraries of object code. Do not install ex-\\necutables here, they probably ought to go in $(libexecdir) instead. The\\nvalue of libdir should normally be /usr/local/lib, but write it as $(exec_\\nprefix)/lib. (If you are using Autoconf, write it as ‘@libdir@’.)\\n\\n‘lispdir’ The directory for installing any Emacs Lisp files in this package. By default,\\nit should be /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp, but it should be written as\\n$(datarootdir)/emacs/site-lisp.\\nIf you are using Autoconf, write the default as ‘@lispdir@’. In order to make\\n‘@lispdir@’ work, you need the following lines in your configure.ac file:\\n\\nlispdir=’${datarootdir}/emacs/site-lisp’\\nAC_SUBST(lispdir)\\n\\n‘localedir’\\n\\nThe directory for installing locale-specific message catalogs for this package.\\nBy default,\\nit should be /usr/local/share/locale, but it should be\\nwritten as $(datarootdir)/locale. (If you are using Autoconf, write it as\\n‘@localedir@’.) This directory usually has a subdirectory per locale.\\n\\nUnix-style man pages are installed in one of the following:\\n\\n‘mandir’\\n\\nThe top-level directory for installing the man pages (if any) for this pack-\\nage. It will normally be /usr/local/share/man, but you should write it as\\n$(datarootdir)/man. (If you are using Autoconf, write it as ‘@mandir@’.)\\n\\n‘man1dir’ The directory for installing section 1 man pages. Write it as $(mandir)/man1.\\n\\n‘man2dir’ The directory for installing section 2 man pages. Write it as $(mandir)/man2\\n\\n‘...’\\n\\nDon’t make the primary documentation for any GNU software be a man page.\\nWrite a manual in Texinfo instead. Man pages are just for the sake of people\\nrunning GNU software on Unix, which is a secondary application only.\\n\\n‘manext’\\n\\nThe file name extension for the installed man page. This should contain a\\nperiod followed by the appropriate digit; it should normally be ‘.1’.\\n\\n‘man1ext’ The file name extension for installed section 1 man pages.\\n\\n‘man2ext’ The file name extension for installed section 2 man pages.\\n\\n‘...’\\n\\nUse these names instead of ‘manext’ if the package needs to install man pages\\nin more than one section of the manual.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n171\\n\\nAnd finally, you should set the following variable:\\n\\n‘srcdir’\\n\\nThe directory for the sources being compiled. The value of this variable is\\nnormally inserted by the configure shell script. (If you are using Autoconf,\\nuse ‘srcdir = @srcdir@’.)\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n# Common prefix for installation directories.\\n# NOTE: This directory must exist when you start the install.\\nprefix = /usr/local\\ndatarootdir = $(prefix)/share\\ndatadir = $(datarootdir)\\nexec_prefix = $(prefix)\\n# Where to put the executable for the command ’gcc’.\\nbindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin\\n# Where to put the directories used by the compiler.\\nlibexecdir = $(exec_prefix)/libexec\\n# Where to put the Info files.\\ninfodir = $(datarootdir)/info\\n\\nIf your program installs a large number of files into one of the standard user-specified\\ndirectories, it might be useful to group them into a subdirectory particular to that program.\\nIf you do this, you should write the install rule to create these subdirectories.\\n\\nDo not expect the user to include the subdirectory name in the value of any of the\\nvariables listed above. The idea of having a uniform set of variable names for installation\\ndirectories is to enable the user to specify the exact same values for several different GNU\\npackages. In order for this to be useful, all the packages must be designed so that they will\\nwork sensibly when the user does so.\\n\\nAt times, not all of these variables may be implemented in the current release of Autoconf\\nand/or Automake; but as of Autoconf 2.60, we believe all of them are. When any are\\nmissing, the descriptions here serve as specifications for what Autoconf will implement. As\\na programmer, you can either use a development version of Autoconf or avoid using these\\nvariables until a stable release is made which supports them.\\n\\n16.6 Standard Targets for Users\\n\\nAll GNU programs should have the following targets in their Makefiles:\\n\\n‘all’\\n\\nCompile the entire program. This should be the default target. This target need\\nnot rebuild any documentation files; Info files should normally be included in\\nthe distribution, and DVI (and other documentation format) files should be\\nmade only when explicitly asked for.\\nBy default, the Make rules should compile and link with ‘-g’, so that executable\\nprograms have debugging symbols. Otherwise, you are essentially helpless in\\nthe face of a crash, and it is often far from easy to reproduce with a fresh build.\\n\\n‘install’ Compile the program and copy the executables, libraries, and so on to the file\\nnames where they should reside for actual use. If there is a simple test to verify\\nthat a program is properly installed, this target should run that test.\\n\\nDo not strip executables when installing them. This helps eventual debugging\\nthat may be needed later, and nowadays disk space is cheap and dynamic loaders\\n\\n\\x0c172\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\ntypically ensure debug sections are not loaded during normal execution. Users\\nthat need stripped binaries may invoke the install-strip target to do that.\\n\\nIf possible, write the install target rule so that it does not modify anything in\\nthe directory where the program was built, provided ‘make all’ has just been\\ndone. This is convenient for building the program under one user name and\\ninstalling it under another.\\n\\nThe commands should create all the directories in which files are to be installed,\\nif they don’t already exist. This includes the directories specified as the values\\nof the variables prefix and exec_prefix, as well as all subdirectories that are\\nneeded. One way to do this is by means of an installdirs target as described\\nbelow.\\n\\nUse ‘-’ before any command for installing a man page, so that make will ignore\\nany errors. This is in case there are systems that don’t have the Unix man page\\ndocumentation system installed.\\n\\nThe way to install Info files is to copy them into $(infodir) with $(INSTALL_\\nDATA) (see Section 16.3 [Command Variables], page 165), and then run the\\ninstall-info program if it is present. install-info is a program that edits\\nthe Info dir file to add or update the menu entry for the given Info file; it is\\npart of the Texinfo package.\\n\\nHere is a sample rule to install an Info file that also tries to handle some\\nadditional situations, such as install-info not being present.\\n\\ndo-install-info: foo.info installdirs\\n\\n$(NORMAL_INSTALL)\\n\\n# Prefer an info file in . to one in srcdir.\\n\\nif test -f foo.info; then d=.; \\\\\\n\\nelse d=\"$(srcdir)\"; fi; \\\\\\n\\n$(INSTALL_DATA) $$d/foo.info \\\\\\n\\n\"$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info\"\\n\\n# Run install-info only if it exists.\\n# Use ’if’ instead of just prepending ’-’ to the\\n# line so we notice real errors from install-info.\\n# Use ’$(SHELL) -c’ because some shells do not\\n# fail gracefully when there is an unknown command.\\n\\n$(POST_INSTALL)\\nif $(SHELL) -c ’install-info --version’ \\\\\\n\\n>/dev/null 2>&1; then \\\\\\n\\ninstall-info --dir-file=\"$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/dir\" \\\\\\n\\n\"$(DESTDIR)$(infodir)/foo.info\"; \\\\\\n\\nelse true; fi\\n\\nWhen writing the install target, you must classify all the commands into\\nthree categories: normal ones, pre-installation commands and post-installation\\ncommands. See Section 16.7 [Install Command Categories], page 176.\\n\\n‘install-html’\\n‘install-dvi’\\n‘install-pdf’\\n‘install-ps’\\n\\nThese targets install documentation in formats other than Info; they’re intended\\nto be called explicitly by the person installing the package, if that format is\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n173\\n\\ndesired. GNU prefers Info files, so these must be installed by the install\\ntarget.\\nWhen you have many documentation files to install, we recommend that you\\navoid collisions and clutter by arranging for these targets to install in subdi-\\nrectories of the appropriate installation directory, such as htmldir. As one\\nexample, if your package has multiple manuals, and you wish to install HTML\\ndocumentation with many files (such as the “split” mode output by makeinfo\\n--html), you’ll certainly want to use subdirectories, or two nodes with the same\\nname in different manuals will overwrite each other.\\nPlease make these install-format targets invoke the commands for the format\\ntarget, for example, by making format a dependency.\\n\\n‘uninstall’\\n\\nDelete all the installed files—the copies that the ‘install’ and ‘install-*’\\ntargets create.\\nThis rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done, only the\\ndirectories where files are installed.\\nThe uninstallation commands are divided into three categories, just like the in-\\nstallation commands. See Section 16.7 [Install Command Categories], page 176.\\n\\n‘install-strip’\\n\\nLike install, but strip the executable files while installing them. In simple\\ncases, this target can use the install target in a simple way:\\n\\ninstall-strip:\\n\\n$(MAKE) INSTALL_PROGRAM=’$(INSTALL_PROGRAM) -s’ \\\\\\n\\ninstall\\n\\nBut if the package installs scripts as well as real executables, the install-strip\\ntarget can’t just refer to the install target; it has to strip the executables but\\nnot the scripts.\\ninstall-strip should not strip the executables in the build directory which are\\nbeing copied for installation. It should only strip the copies that are installed.\\nNormally we do not recommend stripping an executable unless you are sure the\\nprogram has no bugs. However, it can be reasonable to install a stripped exe-\\ncutable for actual execution while saving the unstripped executable elsewhere\\nin case there is a bug.\\n\\nDelete all files in the current directory that are normally created by building\\nthe program. Also delete files in other directories if they are created by this\\nmakefile. However, don’t delete the files that record the configuration. Also\\npreserve files that could be made by building, but normally aren’t because the\\ndistribution comes with them. There is no need to delete parent directories\\nthat were created with ‘mkdir -p’, since they could have existed anyway.\\nDelete .dvi files here if they are not part of the distribution.\\n\\n‘clean’\\n\\n‘distclean’\\n\\nDelete all files in the current directory (or created by this makefile) that are\\ncreated by configuring or building the program. If you have unpacked the source\\nand built the program without creating any other files, ‘make distclean’ should\\n\\n\\x0c174\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nleave only the files that were in the distribution. However, there is no need to\\ndelete parent directories that were created with ‘mkdir -p’, since they could\\nhave existed anyway.\\n\\n‘mostlyclean’\\n\\nLike ‘clean’, but may refrain from deleting a few files that people normally\\ndon’t want to recompile. For example, the ‘mostlyclean’ target for GCC does\\nnot delete libgcc.a, because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot\\nof time.\\n\\n‘maintainer-clean’\\n\\nDelete almost everything that can be reconstructed with this Makefile. This\\ntypically includes everything deleted by distclean, plus more: C source files\\nproduced by Bison, tags tables, Info files, and so on.\\n\\nThe reason we say “almost everything” is that running the command ‘make\\nmaintainer-clean’ should not delete configure even if configure can be re-\\nmade using a rule in the Makefile. More generally, ‘make maintainer-clean’\\nshould not delete anything that needs to exist in order to run configure and\\nthen begin to build the program. Also, there is no need to delete parent direc-\\ntories that were created with ‘mkdir -p’, since they could have existed anyway.\\nThese are the only exceptions; maintainer-clean should delete everything else\\nthat can be rebuilt.\\n\\nThe ‘maintainer-clean’ target is intended to be used by a maintainer of the\\npackage, not by ordinary users. You may need special tools to reconstruct\\nsome of the files that ‘make maintainer-clean’ deletes. Since these files are\\nnormally included in the distribution, we don’t take care to make them easy to\\nreconstruct. If you find you need to unpack the full distribution again, don’t\\nblame us.\\n\\nTo help make users aware of\\nmaintainer-clean target should start with these two:\\n\\nthis,\\n\\nthe\\n\\ncommands\\n\\nfor\\n\\nthe\\n\\nspecial\\n\\n@echo ’This command is intended for maintainers to use; it’\\n@echo ’deletes files that may need special tools to rebuild.’\\n\\nUpdate a tags table for this program.\\n\\nGenerate any Info files needed. The best way to write the rules is as follows:\\n\\n‘TAGS’\\n\\n‘info’\\n\\ninfo: foo.info\\n\\nfoo.info: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi\\n\\n$(MAKEINFO) $(srcdir)/foo.texi\\n\\nYou must define the variable MAKEINFO in the Makefile.\\nmakeinfo program, which is part of the Texinfo distribution.\\n\\nIt should run the\\n\\nNormally a GNU distribution comes with Info files, and that means the Info\\nfiles are present in the source directory. Therefore, the Make rule for an info\\nfile should update it in the source directory. When users build the package,\\nordinarily Make will not update the Info files because they will already be up\\nto date.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n175\\n\\n‘dvi’\\n‘html’\\n‘pdf’\\n‘ps’\\n\\n‘dist’\\n\\nGenerate documentation files in the given format. These targets should always\\nexist, but any or all can be a no-op if the given output format cannot be\\ngenerated. These targets should not be dependencies of the all target; the\\nuser must manually invoke them.\\n\\nHere’s an example rule for generating DVI files from Texinfo:\\n\\ndvi: foo.dvi\\n\\nfoo.dvi: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi\\n\\n$(TEXI2DVI) $(srcdir)/foo.texi\\n\\nYou must define the variable TEXI2DVI in the Makefile.\\nIt should run the\\nprogram texi2dvi, which is part of the Texinfo distribution. (texi2dvi uses\\nTEX to do the real work of formatting. TEX is not distributed with Texinfo.)\\nAlternatively, write only the dependencies, and allow GNU make to provide the\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere’s another example, this one for generating HTML from Texinfo:\\n\\nhtml: foo.html\\n\\nfoo.html: foo.texi chap1.texi chap2.texi\\n\\n$(TEXI2HTML) $(srcdir)/foo.texi\\n\\nAgain, you would define the variable TEXI2HTML in the Makefile; for example,\\nit might run makeinfo --no-split --html (makeinfo is part of the Texinfo\\ndistribution).\\n\\nCreate a distribution tar file for this program. The tar file should be set up so\\nthat the file names in the tar file start with a subdirectory name which is the\\nname of the package it is a distribution for. This name can include the version\\nnumber.\\n\\nFor example, the distribution tar file of GCC version 1.40 unpacks into a sub-\\ndirectory named gcc-1.40.\\n\\nThe easiest way to do this is to create a subdirectory appropriately named, use\\nln or cp to install the proper files in it, and then tar that subdirectory.\\n\\nCompress the tar file with gzip. For example, the actual distribution file for\\nGCC version 1.40 is called gcc-1.40.tar.gz. It is ok to support other free\\ncompression formats as well.\\n\\nThe dist target should explicitly depend on all non-source files that are in the\\ndistribution, to make sure they are up to date in the distribution. See Section\\n“Making Releases” in GNU Coding Standards.\\n\\n‘check’\\n\\nPerform self-tests (if any). The user must build the program before running\\nthe tests, but need not install the program; you should write the self-tests so\\nthat they work when the program is built but not installed.\\n\\nThe following targets are suggested as conventional names, for programs in which they\\n\\nare useful.\\n\\n\\x0c176\\n\\ninstallcheck\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nPerform installation tests (if any). The user must build and install the program\\nbefore running the tests. You should not assume that $(bindir) is in the\\nsearch path.\\n\\ninstalldirs\\n\\nIt’s useful to add a target named ‘installdirs’ to create the directories\\nwhere files are installed, and their parent directories. There is a script called\\nmkinstalldirs which is convenient for this; you can find it in the Gnulib\\npackage. You can use a rule like this:\\n\\n# Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bindir))\\n# actually exist by making them if necessary.\\ninstalldirs: mkinstalldirs\\n\\n$(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs $(bindir) $(datadir) \\\\\\n$(libdir) $(infodir) \\\\\\n$(mandir)\\n\\nor, if you wish to support DESTDIR (strongly encouraged),\\n\\n# Make sure all installation directories (e.g. $(bindir))\\n# actually exist by making them if necessary.\\ninstalldirs: mkinstalldirs\\n\\n$(srcdir)/mkinstalldirs \\\\\\n\\n$(DESTDIR)$(bindir) $(DESTDIR)$(datadir) \\\\\\n$(DESTDIR)$(libdir) $(DESTDIR)$(infodir) \\\\\\n$(DESTDIR)$(mandir)\\n\\nThis rule should not modify the directories where compilation is done. It should\\ndo nothing but create installation directories.\\n\\n16.7 Install Command Categories\\n\\nWhen writing the install target, you must classify all the commands into three categories:\\nnormal ones, pre-installation commands and post-installation commands.\\n\\nNormal commands move files into their proper places, and set their modes. They may\\n\\nnot alter any files except the ones that come entirely from the package they belong to.\\n\\nPre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other files; in particular, they\\n\\ncan edit global configuration files or data bases.\\n\\nPre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal commands, and\\n\\npost-installation commands are typically run after the normal commands.\\n\\nThe most common use for a post-installation command is to run install-info. This\\ncannot be done with a normal command, since it alters a file (the Info directory) which\\ndoes not come entirely and solely from the package being installed. It is a post-installation\\ncommand because it needs to be done after the normal command which installs the package’s\\nInfo files.\\n\\nMost programs don’t need any pre-installation commands, but we have the feature just\\n\\nin case it is needed.\\n\\nTo classify the commands in the install rule into these three categories, insert category\\n\\nlines among them. A category line specifies the category for the commands that follow.\\n\\nA category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make variable, plus an\\noptional comment at the end. There are three variables you can use, one for each category;\\n\\n\\x0cChapter 16: Makefile Conventions\\n\\n177\\n\\nthe variable name specifies the category. Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution\\nbecause these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you should not define them\\nin the makefile).\\n\\nHere are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that explains what it\\n\\nmeans:\\n\\n$(PRE_INSTALL)\\n$(POST_INSTALL)\\n$(NORMAL_INSTALL)\\n\\n# Pre-install commands follow.\\n# Post-install commands follow.\\n# Normal commands follow.\\n\\nIf you don’t use a category line at the beginning of the install rule, all the commands\\nare classified as normal until the first category line. If you don’t use any category lines, all\\nthe commands are classified as normal.\\n\\nThese are the category lines for uninstall:\\n\\n# Pre-uninstall commands follow.\\n# Post-uninstall commands follow.\\n# Normal commands follow.\\nTypically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries from the Info\\n\\n$(PRE_UNINSTALL)\\n$(POST_UNINSTALL)\\n$(NORMAL_UNINSTALL)\\n\\ndirectory.\\n\\nIf the install or uninstall target has any dependencies which act as subroutines of\\ninstallation, then you should start each dependency’s commands with a category line, and\\nstart the main target’s commands with a category line also. This way, you can ensure\\nthat each command is placed in the right category regardless of which of the dependencies\\nactually run.\\n\\nPre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any programs except for\\n\\nthese:\\n\\n[ basename bash cat chgrp chmod chown cmp cp dd diff echo\\nexpand expr false find getopt grep gunzip gzip\\nhostname install install-info kill ldconfig ln ls md5sum\\nmkdir mkfifo mknod mv printenv pwd rm rmdir sed sort tee\\ntest touch true uname xargs yes\\n\\nThe reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the sake of making binary\\npackages. Typically a binary package contains all the executables and other files that need\\nto be installed, and has its own method of installing them—so it does not need to run the\\nnormal installation commands. But installing the binary package does need to execute the\\npre-installation and post-installation commands.\\n\\nPrograms to build binary packages work by extracting the pre-installation and post-\\ninstallation commands. Here is one way of extracting the pre-installation commands (the\\n-s option to make is needed to silence messages about entering subdirectories):\\n\\nmake -s -n install -o all \\\\\\n\\nPRE_INSTALL=pre-install \\\\\\nPOST_INSTALL=post-install \\\\\\nNORMAL_INSTALL=normal-install \\\\\\n\\n| gawk -f pre-install.awk\\n\\nwhere the file pre-install.awk could contain this:\\n\\n$0 ~ /^(normal-install|post-install)[ \\\\t]*$/ {on = 0}\\non {print $0}\\n$0 ~ /^pre-install[ \\\\t]*$/ {on = 1}\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c179\\n\\nAppendix A Quick Reference\\n\\nThis appendix summarizes the directives, text manipulation functions, and special variables\\nwhich GNU make understands.

Errors that are fatal are prefixed with the string ***.\\n\\nError messages are all either prefixed with the name of the program (usually ‘make’),\\nor, if the error is found in a makefile, the name of the file and line number containing the\\nproblem.\\n\\nIn the table below, these common prefixes are left off.\\n\\n‘[foo] Error NN’\\n‘[foo] signal description’\\n\\nThese errors are not really make errors at all. They mean that a program that\\nmake invoked as part of a recipe returned a non-0 error code (‘Error NN’), which\\nmake interprets as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a\\nsignal of some type). See Section 5.5 [Errors in Recipes], page 54.\\n\\nIf no *** is attached to the message, then the sub-process failed but the rule\\nin the makefile was prefixed with the - special character, so make ignored the\\nerror.\\n\\n‘missing separator. Stop.’\\n‘missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?). Stop.’\\n\\nThis means that make could not understand much of anything about the make-\\nfile line it just read. GNU make looks for various separators (:, =, recipe prefix\\ncharacters, etc.) to indicate what kind of line it’s parsing. This message means\\nit couldn’t find a valid one.\\n\\nOne of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or perhaps\\nyour oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows editors) have\\nattempted to indent your recipe lines with spaces instead of a tab character.\\nIn this case, make will use the second form of the error above. Remember\\nthat every line in the recipe must begin with a tab character (unless you set\\n.RECIPEPREFIX; see Section 6.14 [Special Variables], page 80). Eight spaces do\\nnot count. See Section 4.1 [Rule Syntax], page 23.\\n\\n‘recipe commences before first target. Stop.’\\n‘missing rule before recipe. Stop.’\\n\\nThis means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a recipe: it begins\\nwith a recipe prefix character and doesn’t appear to be a legal make directive\\n(such as a variable assignment). Recipes must always be associated with a\\ntarget.\\n\\nThe second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first non-\\nwhitespace character; make interprets this to mean you left out the \"target:\\nprerequisite\" section of a rule. See Section 4.1 [Rule Syntax], page 23.\\n\\n\\x0c188\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n‘No rule to make target ‘xxx’.’\\n‘No rule to make target ‘xxx’, needed by ‘yyy’.’\\n\\nThis means that make decided it needed to build a target, but then couldn’t find\\nany instructions in the makefile on how to do that, either explicit or implicit\\n(including in the default rules database).\\n\\nIf you want that file to be built, you will need to add a rule to your makefile\\ndescribing how that target can be built. Other possible sources of this problem\\nare typos in the makefile (if that file name is wrong) or a corrupted source tree\\n(if that file is not supposed to be built, but rather only a prerequisite).\\n\\n‘No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.’\\n‘No targets. Stop.’\\n\\nThe former means that you didn’t provide any targets to be built on the com-\\nmand line, and make couldn’t find any makefiles to read in. The latter means\\nthat some makefile was found, but it didn’t contain any default goal and none\\nwas given on the command line. GNU make has nothing to do in these situa-\\ntions. See Section 9.1 [Arguments to Specify the Makefile], page 109.\\n\\n‘Makefile ‘xxx’ was not found.’\\n‘Included makefile ‘xxx’ was not found.’\\n\\nA makefile specified on the command line (first form) or included (second form)\\nwas not found.\\n\\n‘warning: overriding recipe for target ‘xxx’’\\n‘warning: ignoring old recipe for target ‘xxx’’\\n\\nGNU make allows only one recipe to be specified per target (except for double-\\ncolon rules). If you give a recipe for a target which already has been defined to\\nhave one, this warning is issued and the second recipe will overwrite the first.\\nSee Section 4.10 [Multiple Rules for One Target], page 39.\\n\\n‘Circular xxx <- yyy dependency dropped.’\\n\\nThis means that make detected a loop in the dependency graph: after tracing\\nthe prerequisite yyy of target xxx, and its prerequisites, etc., one of them\\ndepended on xxx again.\\n\\n‘Recursive variable ‘xxx’ references itself (eventually). Stop.’\\n\\nThis means you’ve defined a normal (recursive) make variable xxx that, when\\nit’s expanded, will refer to itself (xxx). This is not allowed; either use simply-\\nexpanded variables (‘:=’ or ‘::=’) or use the append operator (‘+=’). See\\nChapter 6 [How to Use Variables], page 65.\\n\\n‘Unterminated variable reference. Stop.’\\n\\nThis means you forgot to provide the proper closing parenthesis or brace in\\nyour variable or function reference.\\n\\n‘insufficient arguments to function ‘xxx’. Stop.’\\n\\nThis means you haven’t provided the requisite number of arguments for this\\nfunction. See the documentation of the function for a description of its argu-\\nments. See Chapter 8 [Functions for Transforming Text], page 91.\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix B: Errors Generated by Make\\n\\n189\\n\\n‘missing target pattern. Stop.’\\n‘multiple target patterns. Stop.’\\n‘target pattern contains no ‘%’. Stop.’\\n‘mixed implicit and static pattern rules. Stop.’\\n\\nThese errors are generated for malformed static pattern rules (see Section 4.11.1\\n[Syntax of Static Pattern Rules], page 40). The first means the target-pattern\\npart of the rule is empty; the second means there are multiple pattern characters\\n(%) in the target-pattern part; the third means there are no pattern characters in\\nthe target-pattern part; and the fourth means that all three parts of the static\\npattern rule contain pattern characters (%)–the first part should not contain\\npattern characters.\\nIf you see these errors and you aren’t trying to create a static pattern rule,\\ncheck the value of any variables in your target and prerequisite lists to be sure\\nthey do not contain colons.\\n\\n‘warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.’\\n\\nThis warning and the next are generated if make detects error conditions re-\\nlated to parallel processing on systems where sub-makes can communicate (see\\nSection 5.7.3 [Communicating Options to a Sub-make], page 59). This warning\\nis generated if a recursive invocation of a make process is forced to have ‘-jN’\\nin its argument list (where N is greater than one). This could happen, for\\nexample, if you set the MAKE environment variable to ‘make -j2’. In this case,\\nthe sub-make doesn’t communicate with other make processes and will simply\\npretend it has two jobs of its own.\\n\\n‘warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1. Add ‘+’ to parent make rule.’\\n\\nIn order for make processes to communicate, the parent will pass information to\\nthe child. Since this could result in problems if the child process isn’t actually\\na make, the parent will only do this if it thinks the child is a make. The parent\\nuses the normal algorithms to determine this (see Section 5.7.1 [How the MAKE\\nVariable Works], page 56). If the makefile is constructed such that the parent\\ndoesn’t know the child is a make process, then the child will receive only part\\nof the information necessary. In this case, the child will generate this warning\\nmessage and proceed with its build in a sequential manner.\\n\\n‘warning: ignoring prerequisites on suffix rule definition’\\n\\nAccording to POSIX, a suffix rule cannot contain prerequisites. If a rule that\\ncould be a suffix rule has prerequisites it is interpreted as a simple explicit rule,\\nwith an odd target name. This requirement is obeyed when POSIX-conforming\\nmode is enabled (the .POSIX target is defined).\\nIn versions of GNU make\\nprior to 4.3, no warning was emitted and a suffix rule was created, however\\nall prerequisites were ignored and were not part of the suffix rule. Starting\\nwith GNU make 4.3 the behavior is the same, and in addition this warning is\\ngenerated. In a future version the POSIX-conforming behavior will be the only\\nbehavior: no rule with a prerequisite can be suffix rule and this warning will\\nbe removed.\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0c191\\n\\nAppendix C Complex Makefile Example\\n\\nHere is the makefile for the GNU tar program. This is a moderately complex makefile.\\nThe first line uses a #! setting to allow the makefile to be executed directly.\\n\\nBecause it is the first target, the default goal is ‘all’. An interesting feature of this\\nmakefile is that testpad.h is a source file automatically created by the testpad program,\\nitself compiled from testpad.c.\\n\\nIf you type ‘make’ or ‘make all’, then make creates the tar executable, the rmt daemon\\n\\nthat provides remote tape access, and the tar.info Info file.\\n\\nIf you type ‘make install’, then make not only creates tar, rmt, and tar.info, but\\n\\nalso installs them.\\n\\nIf you type ‘make clean’, then make removes the ‘.o’ files, and the tar, rmt, testpad,\\n\\ntestpad.h, and core files.\\n\\nIf you type ‘make distclean’, then make not only removes the same files as does ‘make\\nclean’ but also the TAGS, Makefile, and config.status files. (Although it is not evident,\\nthis makefile (and config.status) is generated by the user with the configure program,\\nwhich is provided in the tar distribution, but is not shown here.)\\n\\nIf you type ‘make realclean’, then make removes the same files as does ‘make distclean’\\n\\nand also removes the Info files generated from tar.texinfo.\\n\\nIn addition, there are targets shar and dist that create distribution kits.\\n\\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\\n# Generated automatically from Makefile.in by configure.\\n# Un*x Makefile for GNU tar program.\\n# Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\\n\\n# This program is free software; you can redistribute\\n# it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU\\n# General Public License ...\\n...\\n...\\n\\nSHELL = /bin/sh\\n\\n#### Start of system configuration section. ####\\n\\nsrcdir = .\\n\\n# If you use gcc, you should either run the\\n# fixincludes script that comes with it or else use\\n# gcc with the -traditional option.

PREAMBLE\\n\\nThe purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and\\nuseful document free in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom\\nto copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or non-\\ncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications\\nmade by others.\\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document\\nmust themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public\\nLicense, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\\nWe have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because\\nfree software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals\\nproviding the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to\\nsoftware manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or\\nwhether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for\\nworks whose purpose is instruction or reference.\\n\\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\\n\\nThis License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a\\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms\\nof this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in\\nduration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The “Document”,\\nbelow, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and\\nis addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work\\nin a way requiring permission under copyright law.\\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or\\na portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into\\nanother language.\\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document\\nthat deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document\\nto the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that\\ncould fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a\\ntextbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The\\nrelationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related\\nmatters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding\\nthem.\\nThe “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as\\nbeing those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released\\n\\n\\x0c198\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nunder this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is\\nnot allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant\\nSections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\\n\\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover\\nTexts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under\\nthis License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may\\nbe at most 25 words.\\n\\nA “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented\\nin a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for\\nrevising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images com-\\nposed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing\\neditor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to\\na variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise\\nTransparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to\\nthwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image\\nformat is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is\\nnot “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.\\n\\nExamples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without\\nmarkup, Texinfo input format, LaTEX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly\\navailable DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed\\nfor human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF\\nand JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited\\nonly by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or pro-\\ncessing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript\\nor PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.\\n\\nThe “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following\\npages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the\\ntitle page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page”\\nmeans the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the\\nbeginning of the body of the text.\\n\\nThe “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document\\nto the public.\\n\\nA section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either\\nis precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in\\nanother language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such\\nas “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve\\nthe Title” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a\\nsection “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.\\n\\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that\\nthis License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to\\nbe included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties:\\nany other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no\\neffect on the meaning of this License.\\n\\n2. VERBATIM COPYING\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix D: GNU Free Documentation License\\n\\n199\\n\\nYou may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or\\nnoncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license\\nnotice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and\\nthat you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use\\ntechnical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies\\nyou make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.\\nIf you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions\\nin section 3.\\nYou may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly\\ndisplay copies.\\n\\n3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\\n\\nIf you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of\\nthe Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document’s license notice requires\\nCover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all\\nthese Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on\\nthe back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher\\nof these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title\\nequally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition.\\nCopying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the\\nDocument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\\nrespects.\\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put\\nthe first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the\\nrest onto adjacent pages.\\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\\nyou must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque\\ncopy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which\\nthe general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network\\nprotocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.\\nIf\\nyou use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin\\ndistribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will\\nremain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time\\nyou distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that\\nedition to the public.\\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well\\nbefore redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you\\nwith an updated version of the Document.\\n\\n4. MODIFICATIONS\\n\\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions\\nof sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely\\nthis License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing\\ndistribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of\\nit. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the\\nDocument, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any,\\n\\n\\x0c200\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nbe listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as\\na previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\\n\\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for\\nauthorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five\\nof the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer\\nthan five), unless they release you from this requirement.\\n\\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the\\n\\npublisher.\\n\\nD. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\\n\\nE. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other\\n\\ncopyright notices.\\n\\nF. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public\\npermission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form\\nshown in the Addendum below.\\n\\nG. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover\\n\\nTexts given in the Document’s license notice.\\n\\nH. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\\n\\nI. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item\\nstating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version\\nas given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled “History” in the Docu-\\nment, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document\\nas given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as\\nstated in the previous sentence.\\n\\nJ. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to\\na Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in\\nthe Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the\\n“History” section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published\\nat least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the\\nversion it refers to gives permission.\\n\\nK. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve the Title\\nof the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the\\ncontributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\\n\\nL. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and\\nin their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the\\nsection titles.\\n\\nM. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”. Such a section may not be included\\n\\nin the Modified Version.\\n\\nN. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or to conflict in\\n\\ntitle with any Invariant Section.\\n\\nO. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\\n\\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify\\nas Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at\\nyour option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix D: GNU Free Documentation License\\n\\n201\\n\\ntitles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice. These\\ntitles must be distinct from any other section titles.\\n\\nYou may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains nothing but\\nendorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of\\npeer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative\\ndefinition of a standard.\\n\\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up\\nto 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified\\nVersion. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be\\nadded by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already\\nincludes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement\\nmade by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but\\nyou may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that\\nadded the old one.\\n\\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission\\nto use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified\\nVersion.\\n\\n5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\\n\\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License,\\nunder the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you\\ninclude in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,\\nunmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license\\nnotice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\\n\\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\\nInvariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\\nSections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section\\nunique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment\\nto the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined\\nwork.\\n\\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the vari-\\nous original documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any\\nsections Entitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You\\nmust delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”\\n\\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\\n\\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released\\nunder this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various\\ndocuments with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you\\nfollow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all\\nother respects.\\n\\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individu-\\nally under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted\\ndocument, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of\\nthat document.\\n\\n\\x0c202\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\\n\\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent\\ndocuments or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called\\nan “aggregate” if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the\\nlegal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. When\\nthe Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other\\nworks in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\\n\\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,\\nthen if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover\\nTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they\\nmust appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\\n\\n8. TRANSLATION\\n\\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations\\nof the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with\\ntranslations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may\\ninclude translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions\\nof these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the\\nlicense notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you\\nalso include the original English version of this License and the original versions of\\nthose notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and\\nthe original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will\\nprevail.\\n\\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “His-\\ntory”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\\nchanging the actual title.\\n\\n9. TERMINATION\\n\\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly\\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or\\ndistribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\\n\\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular\\ncopyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder\\nexplicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\\nafter the cessation.\\n\\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if\\nthe copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the\\nfirst time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the\\nnotice.\\n\\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties\\nwho have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have\\nbeen terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the\\nsame material does not give you any rights to use it.\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix D: GNU Free Documentation License\\n\\n203\\n\\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\\n\\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free\\nDocumentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\\nto the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\\nSee https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\\nspecifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version”\\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that\\nspecified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by\\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of\\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free\\nSoftware Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future\\nversions of this License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a\\nversion permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.\\n\\n11. RELICENSING\\n\\n“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any World Wide\\nWeb server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities\\nfor anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of\\nsuch a server. A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the\\nsite means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\\n“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license pub-\\nlished by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal\\nplace of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that\\nlicense published by that same organization.\\n“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part\\nof another Document.\\nAn MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this License, and if all works\\nthat were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and\\nsubsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts\\nor invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under\\nCC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is\\neligible for relicensing.\\n\\n\\x0c204\\n\\nGNU make\\n\\nADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\\n\\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the\\ndocument and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\\n\\nyour name.\\n\\nCopyright (C) year\\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover\\nTexts.\\nFree Documentation License’’.\\n\\nA copy of the license is included in the section entitled ‘‘GNU\\n\\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the\\n\\n“with. . .
