You only need to be careful to follow the slam rules when executing judo throws. In wrestling, a slam is lifting and returning an opponent to the mat with unnecessary force.\",\n",

As with most careers in health care, a high school education is the first step to finding entry-level employment. Taking classes in math and science, such as anatomy, biology, chemistry, physiology, and physics, can help prepare students for their college studies and future careers.Earn an associate degree. Entry-level radiologic positions typically require at least an Associate of Applied Science. Before enrolling in one of these degree programs, students should make sure it has been properly accredited by the Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT).Get licensed or certified in the state of Michigan.\"\n",
